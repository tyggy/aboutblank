# 【 Bill Duane】 Buddha and the Corporation in an AI world

## Transcript

we have Mr B D B has been work on work in many leading company like Google G Tech and Amazon including invent the Gmail word manine especially from workshop at White House to teaching Innovation and AI at the Standford Stanford also I think most significant is maybe you all know the searching inside yourself was also one of the main job of bew and build Journey Bri ancient wisdom and cting Age Technology in order to force well-being and ethical explanation for this L thank you for having you here yes let's welcome Bean thank you yeah so thank you very much it's yeah yeah so thank you very much it's very much an honor to be here I want to express some gratitude for everyone who was involved in especially the organization of this and I want to direct some particular gratitude towards venerable epha the last time I spoke at this conference was in 2018 and two very important things happened to me one I was introduced to Thomas Doctor Who you heard from before who since has become I'm a treasured friend and a colleague and he introduced me to Olaf wowski who you'll hear from tomorrow and Lisa Solomon NOA the core founding members of the center for the study of apparent selves which has actually led to that led to a change in the trajectory of my career so thank you for that EA and then also at the conference I met a Chinese woman who became a online friend and I'm happy to report that as of last week we decided to get married so Matchmaker exactly and I have to say I think in terms of value for the price of a conference ticket I think a career and a marriage is very good value so deep deep sincere thank you to that so which brings us to today so we're going to be undergoing a little bit of a switch the world between I'm an engineer so we're going from metaphysics to engineering and this idea of how do we apply this in the world so and it is my sincere goal to finish on time so we're going to try and cover these various things one is I want to explain to a little bit to you about my journey and my journey of healing within the context of a corporate organization two is to bounce between some very important context points about where the world is three a quick review of the mindfulness movement its benefits and its shortcomings within organizations and then end up with some ideas about how to bring everything that we've heard together into a new into a new Endeavor okay so I join this is me at Google thank God I'm not wearing the same shirt that would be annoying I wear the shirt yesterday so I joined Google in 2005 after 10 years of technical Consulting and I worked on web search infrastructure production engineering and then later as mentioned Gmail docs calendar spreadsheets and if I had to describe my engine for my life at that time I would say it was a fear and a shame based engine always trying to outrun my own limitations and what people thought of me and being very focused on that so this is a very powerful engine but it's one that's also quite destructive with a large Shadow and I think it provides a metaphor for some of the energy is at play in some of these corporate environments so being responsible for Google's hypergrowth period running on this engine and then my father died and that experience was so painful to me and my methods of dealing with it I had very Advanced stress reduction strategies it was the bourbon and cheeseburger method which does not scale I tried to and so I went to interestingly a lecture on the Neuroscience of emotion and that told me that my own internal experience could be understood and there was something called neuroplasticity that said you can change the structure and function of your brain and I think we've heard in the earlier talks the limitations of a mindset that's specifically focused on that but I have to say Neo Buddhism May though it may have been it was utterly healing and transformative and absolutely set the stage to turn the most painful moment of my life into one of deep exploration and healing so I bottomed out on the secular mindfulness programs like mindfulness based stress reduction and search inside yourself pretty early so I wanted to see as we say in computer science I want to see the source code which led me to explore Buddhism and then again continuing this transformation process I've probably said about 30 or 35 Retreats I did five years of Buddhist teacher training in the Ain cha T Forest lineage and around this time I wanted to shift my life to be more of service so I switched from being an engineering executive to running the well-being program as was discussed and then that led to to Innovation so I think this points to the idea that we can use the difficulty in our lives in our contexts even if those contexts are not ideal to really grow and we'll come back to that idea in a little bit and it's always funny when you get introduced they always talk about all the good stuff that you've done and all the impressive sounding stuff but I also want to note that in addition to being an expert and an adviser I am also a an an expert and an adviser I am also a student and so I really want to give reverence to the teachers that have helped transform my life and Professor Ting I think it was really inspired me with the pictures of him and and his teachers so changeing gears completely let's talk about the context of the world I'm going to bounce around we've heard during the talks and certainly if you read the newspapers it's like we're doomed or this will be the best thing ever which is it the answer is yes with a view towards finishing on time I'm going to make these slides available I'm just going to describe them at high level what this means is that the major these are this is leaders in businesses it basically means that within three years these leaders are expecting that more than 20% of the workforce will need to be reskilled and the size of that Workforce will shrink dramatically as was mentioned in one of the earlier talks one cannot ignore the societal implications of that much disruption particularly during a time when populism is on the rise and leading to really unpleasant things something of note that I communicate to my clients is that the usual way these things go is these dislocations are mostly visited on people who have less power AI is really interesting is it really reaching up into the middle and the upper middle classes attorneys for example climate change I really believe what was said before I think this is a much bigger existential threat than AI at least in the foreseeable term but certainly global warming is is going southeast Asia 20% of the population is going to hit the road within the next 50 years this one is deeply deeply sad so the numbers on the left right here these are young people and then going to older people here and this means that young people have poor spiritual health self-reported this means their connection with other people their sense of meaning and purpose and having an ethos and you see social health and poor mental health I wouldn't be surprised if these were the effects of pollution from what was called earlier the attention and the intention economies so I think this is really really important and I think as older people it's really important to realize that young people need our help and assistance by the way this is the last depressing graph this is from the United States we see that these diseases of Despair have really been increasing recently mostly driven by the Oxycontin and Fentanyl things so obviously things are terrible we should all despair but at the same time this is also true even the ones on the right are places where colonialism was really at effect so it lags quite a bit but child mortality rate is the lowest it's ever been education is really continually on the uprising and this is very interesting to me this basically shows that there's a correlation between economic activity and self-reported life satisfaction so this to me says one of the things that's really come up recently is well is AI good or bad again the answer is yes and I think the thing that's pointed to is that different solutions are useful for different contexts so I think we can see some of the economic and systems of power that are producing the negative stuff in the first are also producing these positive things so I think that's a very if you read the Press it's so easy to follow either things are amazing or things are amazing or things are terrible whereas I think it's really this idea of of things being very very contextual and what we look at is we say well the traditional counterweight to corporate capitalist power is government so this is research from the Edelman Foundation that has showed over the last 20 years people's faith and this is the this this is 28 countries and I think about 16, 000 people notably this data excludes China and this for the last 20 years government has gone from here to here so I'm deeply concerned that we're going into this period without a functional ability of government to limit so these are the things that I advise my clients to be very aware of and then of course we have ai all these questions about is it sentient is it not I don't think it matters in the short term because it's our relationship to it if we if we interact with it as though it was sensient then I think that is powerful enough where we have a lot of short-term things to both be worried about and helpful okay so just to sum up the bills for unlimited growth are coming due I think a lot of these things where we're just worrying about global climate change you can't have unlimited glow growth forever life has gotten better in many ways for many people there's a sense that the systems we create may be beyond our control combined with a massive decrease in trust and institutions so I think this is the Strategic scenario and the reason why it took some time to go through all this is very important when we discuss any particular topic of AI that we contextualize it with all these other things that are going on in the world what's absolutely clear to me is that we are at an inflection point in history and now for wholesomeness to have to be able to flower we really need to not just narrow down in our specific domains but to look at the broader picture okay now shifting again to this idea of of going back towards how might Buddhism interact with these one of the guys from the center for the study of apparent selves with these mertile points of interests so the first wave of mindfulness incorpor of Buddhism in mindfulness maybe aside from uak kin in Myanmar was mindfulness and I mentioned this was transformative for my life and it was really skills-based self-awareness self-regulation connection understanding the skills to be trained and you can see there was a massive increase in popular attention as well as scientific press around this if I were to describe that movement as a whole as someone who administered and was on the board of some of these programs is that initially it was focused on individual and team performance the material on concentration was more present than the material on compassion although as the research around compassion became more strong they began to become more equal over time generally these programs talk about the importance of ethics without putting forth an actual normative structure around them this is generally due to the idea well probably two things one is in a diverse environment you don't want to be enforcing one particular religious view on a broad group of people and also leaving it fuzzy leaves the companies more room to operate and then huge benefits right especially at the individual level self-awareness self-regulation kindness meaning and purpose so huge amounts of benefits and I don't think there's any person who I I don't think there's any person who would say who's been involved with this that it had the long-term systemic impact we hope it would we thought if we train these people with these skills then certainly it might shift the entire system towards the better and I I don't think that happened okay so I really love evans's book the blind spot I was so happy to read it I read it very very quickly and I think this is really important because when we start thinking about what do we do now I really think to meet with honor the self-interest of the people and the organizations I did not come to meditation to realize what I believe now that the world is very sincerely and practically made of love everything I wanted to suffer a little bit less so I think if we can take we can meet people where they are and give them a program that's much deeper and right now the key thing that I want to tell you about is that for these large tech companies the things that used to be predictive for them in the past are starting to lose their predictive power it's really amazing to me that Google launched a new AI thing in search two weeks ago that did terribly how is that possible they've been working on it for years and I think the result of this is not only do we have the blind spot of extrapolatory reductionist science and engineering but on top of that we have a blind spot within us if we don't have a vocabulary around around compassion about how caring for other people works about how to perceive and cognize these things how could we possibly build tools so we have inner blind spots that are aligning with external blind spots now the good news is that this is causing pain and discomfort at the organizational level so I think it might be interesting to say actually a lot of what's been talked about today are ways at the individual level and perhaps the organizational level of perceiving and cognizing these spaces that the blind spot spot looking at the blind spot has difficulty and if they do that that they'll have more ability to Traverse some of the problem spaces they're in and one of the key ways to do this I think is to change from me to we one of the things with all the limitations of LM is one of the things I think they're really great at and I don't know if you've done this is you say could you please tell the story from this person's point of view it actually does a great job of doing that so that ability to expand what we're looking at so as an example of this let's say that you're driving in your car and you're late for your doctor's appointment and an effort to regain some of the time you start slaming your traffic through traffic and this of course makes traffic worse the more people that do this the slower traffic goes however if you switch from I am stuck in traffic to I am traffic then all of a sudden a number of means of traversing that problem space become calculable as winning so that if there's something that help humans make that shift from me to we and I do think that even the with all the limitations of AI we've been hearing about this is possible which then brings us I'm going to cover very quickly since Thomas covered it yesterday of the stress care loop with this idea of care is a driver of intelligence so Thomas mentioned this that we start off with stress or Dua and then care which then leads to intelligent in greef perception so part of the reason we use the word care which is a little unsatisfying is that this model is intended to to be scale-free this is intended to work at the basil cellular level and also the super organizational level so Tomas discussed that I think in terms of mostly in terms of a human individual but now imagine taking what I just said and recontextualizing it that an organization doesn't have a great way of perceiving that which is extremely causal the things that are extremely causal in this world are love and Trust and meaning and purpose that whole the data points I showed initially shows the way that the world destabilizes when we don't pay attention to that but a lot of these organizations we have this way this engineering way of looking at the world that's so good for solving the problems that are getting much better but have these other things where the externalities which of course aren't actually externalities are so hard to measure which is rather convenient so if we think about how could we give these organizations and of of course the individuals within them this idea to perceive and cognize things that are important but very hard to measure and hard to measure Falls in two different categories one is there's just no good measure for it like love and then the second is is that in the complexity and ambiguity of this world the relationships are so complex that the best you can come up with in terms of a mathematical analysis is correlation whereas every business wants a hard causality and so the other thing I want to mention is care arguments Thomas and I had initially thank you were I said this is a great model but it doesn't really match the world so what if what if a being had infinite perception but it was evil beings are numberless and I will enslave them all for I am zorg God emperor of the Universe and I said what would that and Thomas's point that he EV he eventually convinced me of is that if you have enough hair then you can actually not collapse into an ie mind way of solving the problem this is when you say I am traffic versus I am stuck in traffic so the other thing that needs to be done for this model to work at an organizational level is methods of perception and cognizing things that are hard and then the second part is care okay so just a recap before we finish up the limits of self-interest are becoming keenly apparent the limits of reduction linear thinking and problem solving are becoming self-evident in some domains this provides the motivation of organizations to pursue this for their own Survival which really Echoes my my own experiences when I hit my dooka wall a desire for wholesomeness is rising the fact that those kids really they're dying literally unfortunately for meaning and purpose and decency and this is a huge power that if we can meet it and then my belief is like literally love is the only rational move in this realm of interconnected and interdependence so I want to talk to you about an experiment about operationalizing love what if we had tools and methods that developed our ability to perceive me versus we and this is crucial this can just not be code this needs to be the humans making the code and I know I will not work with any organization that refuses that aspect of it to do training in care and compassion self-awareness self-regulation and what if we were actually able to present these tools as something that would actually help them do what they're going to do and again this means we have to be careful about which problems we engage with and then maybe one day maybe maybe these tools we're talking about become part of this Wii so Olaf and I are launching the center for compassionate complexity to help do these problems or explore this problem space and Google X just hired us to do research and Implement human AI hybrid systems of care so Google X is the Skunk Works the part of Google that does experimentation and crazy projects and basically they want us to explore their problems and to say what's a place where you could try and test this hypothesis that care is a driver of intelligence so happy and excited with that and that's my talk and I finished on time yay ---
