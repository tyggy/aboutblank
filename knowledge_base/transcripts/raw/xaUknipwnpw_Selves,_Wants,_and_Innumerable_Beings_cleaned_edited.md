# Selves, Wants, and Innumerable Beings

## Transcript


My name is [[Michael Levin]]. I run the [[Allen Discovery Center]] at Tus University. This is a website where you can find all the primary papers, data sets, software, and everything else from our work. This is my personal blog where I try to explain what some of these things mean, or at least what I think they mean.

Today I'd like to talk about some new science that I think really intersects with issues that, as Buddhists, you're probably interested in. I want to make clear that I am not a Buddhist scholar. I don't have extremely deep knowledge of the classics in this field, but I think I know some of the big ideas, and I think it's extremely relevant. We do a lot of this work in concert with our collaborators at the [[Center For The Study Of Apparent Selves]]. Today I'd like to talk about a few issues and some of our work that sheds light on them.

In 25 minutes, I really don't have time to show you very much of the primary data. I'm going to make some fairly unconventional claims, and those usually need to come with all the primary data. So I encourage you to visit the website and look at the actual papers, because there's a ton of empirical research and material that goes into some of the things I'm going to say today. But I'd like to give an overview first.

One of the things we've been working on is a framework for recognizing and ethically relating to a very wide range of [[Unconventional Beings]]. In order to understand the full range of other minds around us, we need to understand the origins of our own bodies and minds. I'm going to talk about a few things. First, I'll show you how bodies [[Self]]-assemble from [[Agential Material]]. This leads to an issue I call [[Pheno-Buddhism]]—the question of how far down the scale of organization these concepts extend.

I'm going to talk about selves, not as permanent objects, but as a [[Self]]-telling, [[Self As Self-Telling Story]] that holds together the components of a body and mind. I'm going to argue that there actually is good evidence for a non-physical component to our architecture—an [[Ingressing Mind]] as a pattern in [[Platonic Space]] that comes through the physical body as an interface into this conventional physical world.

Overall, I think we need to understand a wide range of new kinds of beings who live out their lives, suffer, and strive for goals in spaces other than the familiar three-dimensional outer world of behavior. This will challenge our commitment to enlarge our [[Cognition]] to exert active [[Compassion]] for all [[Sentient Beings]], because some of these are actually very hard to observe. This framework has led to very specific, practical, novel discoveries.

Most of my lab is a wet lab that generates advances in [[Regenerative Medicine]], bioengineering, and AI. The philosophy really matters, and we try to keep it tightly integrated with the science so there's benefit in both directions. I think both science and Buddhism are going to need to be updated in the future.

The first thing I want to point out is that when we talk about [[Compassion]] for innumerable beings, we have to understand what beings are. In the Western world, this view predominates: a piece of classical art called "Adam Names the Animals in the Garden of Eden." The idea is that there's a discrete set of physical, familiar, embodied forms—plants and animals. Adam is unique, but his job is to name the animals. In these traditions, naming means that when you've discovered or given something a name, you've understood its true nature. That part is profound—we are going to have to understand the true nature of many different beings, and it is our responsibility.

But what I think is wrong or limiting here is that it only shows these conventional, brainy sorts of bodies. This is only the beginning, the tip of the iceberg. The standard modern human, which features so prominently in philosophy of mind discussions and religious traditions, is at the center of two continuous distributions.

We all started life as a single cell, both on the evolutionary scale and developmentally. We slowly and gradually become what we are now. Whatever we think about the properties we have—the ability to hold goals and be responsible for our actions—we need a continuous story that says how those things scale up from when you're a single cell. Where exactly does that agential quality appear? At what point during evolution and embryogenesis does that occur?

But also, through biological and technological changes, there is a wide range of intermediate forms that are not only possible but becoming real right now and will become even more so. Again, one has to ask when our human possibilities and responsibilities kick in and where they extend.

Using a sharp category of beings that need to make decisions and be responsible for themselves simply won't work. We have to understand how this changes and scales with all kinds of novel scenarios. This means that whatever discussions we have about Buddhism and AI, it's not just about AI. The point isn't about software agents. The point is that these [[Cyborg]] creatures—composites of technology and natural evolution—are already with us. They're going to be living with us, and in fact, this is going to be all of us.

We really need to understand what this means for various philosophical traditions. Part of this is understanding where we actually come from and how our bodies get here. When we look at an embryo, what are we seeing? There are millions of cells. What are we calling an embryo? When we look at an embryonic blastula, what allows us to call this one embryo? What are we counting when we say here's a single being coming into the world?

What we're counting is actually alignment. The fact that all these cells are in agreement about their journey in [[Anatomical Morphospace]] and where they're going to go and what they're going to make. In that sense, the embryo is a [[Self]]-reinforcing, highly compelling illusion. It is an illusion because you really have just a bunch of cells, and it is only an embryo to the extent that the cells believe they're all working toward one goal. On the other hand, it's an enabling vision. It's what enables them to project their will into [[Anatomical Morphospace]] and become this amazing, higher-order construct—to make a body.

This is [[Self]]-reinforcing: the more the pattern gets taken up by cells, the more they reinforce that pattern for each other, and all of them move forward and create something like this. The number of individuals in an embryonic blastula is not fixed. If you make little scratches in it, each island won't feel the presence of the others and will self-organize into an embryo. You could have anywhere from zero to about half a dozen individuals coming from the same embryonic mass.

So again, we have this question of how many actual selves are there in a particular piece of this [[Self]]-organizing medium. This is a very dynamic process—you can have twins, triplets, quadruplets. The same issues come up in [[Cognition]] with [[Commissurotomy]] patients and dissociative [[Identity]] disorders, where multiple [[Individuality]] personalities share the same brain. This is how we are formed: through a persistent [[Self-Model]] that develops in cells.

This is what we're made of—[[Individuality]] cells. Here you can see how molecules become a form of unicellular life. And down here is a sad video showing the reverse process: how the death of the unicellular organism leads to just organic molecules, a mess of molecular remnants.

What we're seeing is that below the single-cell level, even without a brain or nervous system, there's tremendous purposeful action. The cell is very competent at getting its goals met in its environment. Below this level are the molecular networks that underlie it. The border between a bunch of molecules—the province of chemistry and physics—lies right next to the province of life and behavioral science.

The border between life and death is very thin at this level. How far down do the concepts we're interested in go? In terms of delusions and false beliefs about yourself and the outside world, what's going on here? Do these cells have that? Do they generate karma? Are they in need of liberation? We might agree the answer is probably yes, because these are very clearly active living organisms.

But because they're made of molecular networks, the question becomes: [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]] the chemistry have those things as well? Can chemistry make mistakes? Can chemistry have attachments? If not, you have to explain why these molecules don't have it anymore when seconds ago they did, as part of an organism.

We really need to understand what's going on in that transition. I don't believe there is any transition. I think it scales smoothly all the way down. Part of that is that we actually found that molecular networks themselves—not cells, but the molecular networks themselves—also have, for example, six different kinds of learning. We use this in our lab to do things like drug conditioning. We can actually train molecular networks. In addition to habituation and sensitization, they also do Pavlovian conditioning.

The very material you're made of—the very chemistry you're made of—already has learning capacity. It's not a passive medium. It's not even just a computational medium. It's an agential medium that we're all made of. I really think that many of the concepts we think about go all the way to the bottom.

This has an implication: [[Embodiment]] as we traditionally recognize it—we recognize medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds through three-dimensional space as [[Intelligence]]. This is only the beginning of the story. Biology lives in many different spaces. Cells, tissues, and molecular networks navigate other spaces—very weird, high-dimensional spaces that are hard for us to recognize. They live in worlds like transcriptional space—the space of all possible gene expression. They live in physiological state space. The one we spend the most time studying is anatomical morph space: the space you traverse from being a single fertilized egg to the body shape you have now.

All these are spaces in which these systems make decisions, strive for goals, and suffer—meaning they experience [[Stress]] when their goals aren't met. They minimize that [[Stress]] by navigating those spaces to their goal states.

This has massive implications for [[Embodiment]] in AI. When people say an AI doesn't have a real mind because it's not embodied—not traversing physical space, interacting with objects the way we do—that doesn't mean it's not embodied. It may well have a body that navigates other kinds of abstract spaces, and that perception-action-[[Stress]] loop may play out in lots of spaces we have a hard time noticing.

Let me show you what the [[Collective Intelligence Of Cells]] looks like as it moves through [[Anatomical Morphospace]]. It has attachments to certain goals. For example, this is an axolotl, an amphibian that can regenerate many body parts. When they inevitably bite each other's legs off, no matter where the amputation takes place, the cellular collective very quickly works hard, spends lots of energy, gets back to where it needs to be, and then stops.

While no [[Individuality]] cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed to have, the collective has this homeostatic loop. It has a goal, a set point. If you deviate from that goal, it will traverse back. It will travel through [[Anatomical Morphospace]] and get back to where it needs to go. It has a very active and powerful attachment to this particular goal.

We study how [[Stress]] drives this process and how you can have a very basic model of attachment and [[Dukkha]] by looking at the [[Stress]]-driven pursuit of goals by groups of cells. There's something else going on: there's a holistic order to it. If you surgically graft this tail to the middle of the animal, the cells will slowly remodel it into a limb—a structure more appropriate to the new large-scale anatomy. Even the cells at the tip of the tail will become fingers, even though locally there's nothing wrong with them.

The collective has an attachment to a specific goal state in [[Anatomical Morphospace]]. It knows that having a tail in the middle is not correct; it needs to have a limb. That desire, that pressure to do that, propagates down even into [[Individuality]] cells, which locally have no problem. They could have stayed as they were, but they don't, because the imperative to make a correct larger-scale structure filters down to the molecular networks that guide individual cell behaviors.

The whole thing—the nature of this body—is literally held together by the collective shared model of what they should be doing. What makes it a tail or a limb, as opposed to just a pile of [[Individuality]] cells, is their collective goal of maintaining roughly the right configuration. Shared goal states are the organizing principle for keeping a [[Self]] together. The anatomical self is held together by this cognitive glue—the shared goals and the [[Stress]] of not meeting them—in our biological substrate.

We call this a [[Multiscale Competency Architecture]]: every layer is able to solve problems and achieve goals in different kinds of spaces. Now we have to ask: How do these systems remember their goals? What is the cognitive glue that allows a collective to reach a group goal?

How do group goals bind [[Individuality]] subunits together into new beings distinct from others? You have the goals of your molecular networks, then those of the cell, the tissue, and the entire organism. This is conventional behavior at the level of the organism. How do they remember and pursue these goals?

We know how this works in the brain and nervous system. There's an electrical network in your brain that allows very high-level abstract goals—around right action and so on—to filter down and actually change the chemistry of your muscle cells, making your muscles contract so you can execute those goals. It's an amazing architecture that allows abstract principles to control the chemistry in your body.

These electrical signals control your muscles so you can move through three-dimensional space and have actions that generate consequences. But evolution discovered this a really long time ago. This is an ancient architecture. All cells in your body have [[Ion Channels]] and [[Gap Junctions]]. The electrical network of your brain actually evolved from a much older electrical network in your body, and that network wasn't about action in the three-dimensional world. It was about action in [[Anatomical Morphospace]]—issuing commands to move your body configuration through [[Anatomical Morphospace]]. That's how it remembered what a proper embryo looks like, how groups of cells remember how many fingers you have.

We've done a lot of work to develop the first technologies to read and write the mind of that [[Collective Intelligence]]. We use the [[Collective Intelligence Of Cells]] as a model system for understanding, detecting, and trying to communicate with a very unconventional [[Intelligence]] that lives in [[Anatomical Morphospace]].

Here, the colors in grayscale represent voltages we can read out with a [[Membrane Potential (Vmem)]]-sensitive fluorescent dye. This is an early frog embryo putting its face together. One frame from that video shows the memory of what it's going to do to build a face. Here's where the eye will form later. Here's where the mouth will form. These electrical pattern memories control all the gene expression domains and ultimately the anatomy. This is literally reading the mind of the body.

You can see [[Individuality]] cells have all sorts of interesting electrical properties and are having electrical conversations. Much like neuroscience tries to read out the mental content of your brain by scanning electrophysiology, we try to do the same thing in the body and understand what this [[Collective Intelligence]] is trying to do.

Once we understand—we call this cracking the [[Bioelectric Code]]—we can actually speak that language and issue commands or communicate with it to reset its goals. For example, here's a tadpole side view. Here's the eye, the brain up here, the mouth and the gut. While these cells normally have a stable goal of making a gut organ, we can issue a communication to a few of these cells using ion channel RNA and ask them to build an eye instead. Sure enough, they take on that new goal and build an extra eye with a lens and optic nerve.

They commit to that goal so well that these cells we injected will recruit their neighbors. All these other cells in the eye aren't directly injected by us, but they're recruited by these cells to participate. It's such a compelling vision that they actually transmit that vision to their neighbors—you can actually see that happen.

Besides changing goals once you understand that cognitive glue and how bodies come to be held together, we can actually reset the borders of the [[Self]]. [[Individuality]] cells have little tiny goals—keeping pH or hunger level at a particular range. Groups of cells can merge into collectives that remember much bigger goals, such as this grandiose anatomical goal. The size of the goal you're able to pursue rises in evolution and embryogenesis. It gets bigger and projects into new problem spaces—from physiological space to [[Anatomical Morphospace]].

These kinds of things are intensely practical because you can use them to drive biomedical interventions. For example, this is our approach to [[Cancer]]. If you put in a human gene, they'll make a tumor. These cells disconnect from their neighbors and roll back to their past. As far as they're concerned, the rest of the body is just external environment. They're going to live their best life, which is metastasis.

We can prevent that process not by killing them, not by fixing the genetic defect, but simply by forcing them into a correct electrical state that keeps them coupled to the network. Then they don't have [[Individuality]] thoughts about crawling off and doing other things. They stay on task in this giant mind meld and build skin and muscle. Here's the same animal with the ANKA protein blazingly expressed. There's no tumor because it's not the genetic state that drives [[Cancer]]—it's the commitment and the size of your goals. If we keep that boundary between [[Self]] and world large enough so that they remember organ-level goals, this is a new therapeutic we're working on.

The scale of the largest goal you can pursue—we call this the [[Cognitive Light Cone]]—in space and time, the largest goal you can pursue, not how far your senses can reach or how far out you can affect things, but the size of the goal in whatever space, even if it's not physical space. This [[Cognitive Light Cone]] gives us interesting ideas. You can see this worked out in papers where the area of concern—the goal states you're pursuing—can be thought of as a [[Cognitive Light Cone]].

Wouldn't it be interesting to think about the [[Bodhisattva]] vow as a commitment to enlarge our own [[Cognitive Light Cone]] to comprise bigger and bigger groups of [[Sentient Beings]] as part of our primary circle of [[Compassion]]?

All of this is discussed in papers where we talk about forming a loop as a driver of [[Intelligence]] and the increase of this [[Cognitive Light Cone]]. In the last couple of minutes, I want to talk about the implications this has beyond natural beings whose bodies evolved through evolutionary processes. I think this is really what the garden is going to look like—much weirder than the original.

The issue of [[Care]] and the [[Cognitive Light Cone]] is at the center of three really interesting domains of research. I want to introduce you to one creature. You might think this is something we found at the bottom of a pond with an ancient genome. We call it an anthrobot. These are actually comprised of adult human cells. We take adult human tracheal epithelial cells from patients, some of whom are deceased. This is a weird life after death for that patient.

These cells [[Self]]-organize into an entirely new creature with a new morphology and new sets of behaviors. This doesn't look like any stage of human development. It's a completely different being. We haven't touched the genome. We haven't put in any reprogramming factors, no [[Artificial Life]]. This is what the cells already know how to do. These have never existed in evolution.

These behaviors—they express about half the genome, over 9,000 genes, in new ways other than what the cells were doing inside the body. They have lots of new behaviors. One of the things they know how to do is heal neural wounds. These are human neurons. We made a big scar, a big scratch that's neural damage, and these things gather together to heal it. You can see here they're healing across the gap. Where do all these abilities come from?

You can't blame a long history of evolutionary selection because there have never been [[Anthrobots]]. There's never been selection to be a good anthrobot. Where do the goals, preferences, and attachments of novel beings that have never been here before come from?

I also want to point out that it doesn't take cells, it doesn't take life, it doesn't take huge complexity to do this. Even extremely simple models—and I don't have time to get into this—you can see some of this discussed in papers and on my blog. Even simple things like bubble sort—a simple six-line computer algorithm, totally deterministic—have interesting competencies like delayed gratification. They do weird side quests besides sorting numbers that are literally not in the algorithm. Even something as simple as bubble sort has apparent desires and competencies that aren't in the algorithm.

We have to be careful. I think this is a really important point: these kinds of things go all the way down into very simple systems. We tend to greatly underestimate the capabilities of matter and so-called machines. For the exact same reason that our mind isn't fully encompassed by the laws of biochemistry, machines aren't encompassed by our formal models of algorithms and materials. The same kinds of things apply to even very simple systems.

I do not actually believe there's any such thing as dead matter. I've been in debates with people, for example from the Vedanta school, who want to keep a strong separation between the magic of life and so-called dead matter. I don't believe there's any dead matter anywhere.

When we start asking where these patterns of behavior, goals, and competencies arise in biologicals that have never been evolved—but also in simple technological constructs and [[Cyborg]]—where do they come from? I think the best answer currently is that they come from the same place the structure of mathematical objects comes from. Not from physical space. I think there is a [[Platonic Space Of Forms]]. Some we recognize as having low [[Agency]], like facts of number theory. Others are highly active, highly complex forms that we'd recognize as kinds of propensities for behavior—kinds of minds.

I think we are residents of this space who occasionally project into the physical world through physical bodies, through interfaces like biological bodies, [[Hybrots]], computers, machines. All of these can serve as interfaces to highly complex non-physical patterns that come through. Scientifically, we're currently very bad at recognizing when that's about to happen.

This is really important because we're living in, and increasingly will be living in, a world where biological endless forms—most beautiful in Darwin's phrase—are just a tiny corner of this whole space. We're going to have to learn to enter [[Ethical Symbiosis]] with beings that are extremely diverse: many different combinations of algorithms, engineering, evolved life, and ingressing patterns that form our minds. Our psychological profiles need to be understood as they come through these interfaces to enable us to have mutually flourishing experiences.

I'll stop here and just say that all of this is discussed in many papers. I'm happy to send these to you if you're interested. I want to thank the students and postdocs who [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]] all the work, especially our collaborators in this specific field that I talked about today, and our many funders. I have to make a disclosure: these are three companies that have commercialized advances that have come from this thinking.
