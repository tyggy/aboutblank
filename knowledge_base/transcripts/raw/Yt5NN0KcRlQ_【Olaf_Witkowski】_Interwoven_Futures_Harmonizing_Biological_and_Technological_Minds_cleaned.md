## Transcript

and next we are moving on our next speaker Dr Olaf with kovski funding director of coros label discuss the in web future harmonizes biological and technological Minds the FL is yours thank you perfect thank you I will use thank all right first of course I would like to thank everyone organizing this and especially venerable yea for having me here I want to share that we had so many Jazzy conversations already and I'm so happy in spite of having my son being born very very soon I could make it here thank you so much for sharing and all the discussions maybe because we haven't maybe met before some of you here a few words about my background I came from basically computer I I came from basically computer science and maybe cognitive science as well I started of as trying to decode old archaeological artifacts trying to make sense of meaning that is some sometimes lost and I went into after creating a few businesses I went back into research because my heart was there I wanted to understand what what is the emergence of communication between any agents and of course I started with simulation because that was my strength and then I went into went to the US at The Institute for Advance study we focused on the emergence of awareness and how come this comes about in our universe and try to understand that from physical laws and information science I came back recently a few years ago to Japan and founded cross Labs where I focus now on hybrid intelligences and that's what I would like to share with you today maybe I'll mention a few other side Adventures actually I'll I'll mention only one which is the center for the study of apparent El we have Bill and Thomas Lisa is not here today A few few others with us and yeah I want to thank everyone who collaborated with me in all this research that you'll you'll see it's not just my effort it's really a group effort if anyone is coming to Kyoto I invit a few of you and a few of you are coming already please visit me in Kyoto and we have a nice Center where we study diverse types of intelligences and cognitions here are a few examples of the type of things we do focus on the science of collective intelligence but also open-ended learning how you always need data more data in order to learn that's not true it turns out that you can set up open-ended machine intelligence that doesn't need to do that bit like a mathematician would discover new things and hopefully we include that in the future of AI also we are interested in experience and we'll share a little bit about that in second really all of this is at the intersection of three things are very close to my heart one of them is of course AI which is my background but also artificial life which is a study of synthetic biology but also life as it could be as we haven't discovered it yet maybe alien life as well and finally the study of artificial neurop phenomenology or a study of experience awareness and consciousness I want to be very honest with you today and my background although I've been exposed for the last eight nine years to Buddhist philosophy I'm no no expert and I would really welcome your feedback and if we don't have time to chat today please email me I'm easy to reach and will'll always answer your emails online so please reach out with your so so please reach out with your comments and I want to explore today our resonance and really be very modest in what I would pretend to know about what you are EXP in let me start with talking a little bit about diverse Minds suspending our judgment about what they should be and what we are sure they are about because I also don't really know I'll introduce my first field that's what I graduated and got a PhD and artificial life is the study of life as it could be it's not simply biology you could call that Universal biology and a lot of that is within various substrates chemistry digital we include everything but also we include mixing them together mixing and mashing them and a few examples are here you go into neural cellular digital worlds and mix them together maybe this study by our colleagues Mike Levin Josh bongard and so on created xenobots also anthropods that mix the digital kinds of life that mix that into a cellular well life that we know about and it's really hybs right it's not simply robots it's hybrid robots that mix with our known biology this is maybe the summary of my view today and it's rather simple and you're familiar with this of course this has a lot of intersections with what you're expert in I'm more familiar with maybe K School philosophy and also with anything linked to an activism and so on this is really about the inter interaction between human and AI as a loop and I want to emphasize that and give you the my take-home message in case I don't finish my slides like a good academic we're used to that at least you'll have this to go on I think offloading intelligence is very very different from augmenting it and I don't think my field in AI realized that yet we talk about it but we don't really have the solutions and we're not looking strongly enough the example that often I get in conversation is Google Maps Google Maps we use it in order to orient ourselves and in the end we can forget about orienting ourselves in our brains and Minds U really it's not necessary and we're replacing one by one a bit like using a calculator right with a very narrow channel of communication between the two and us we are replacing one by one the pieces of cognition is this augmenting my intelligence is it augmenting my understanding and care for society and everything I don't really think so J GPT maybe another version of the same thing isn't that doesn't that sound dangerous slippery slope but we can be saved and this is my favorite example the sang many names in different cultures I've never really learned how to use it properly but I learned a little bit and this little bit really increases my understanding of mathematics quite exponentially really directly I understand it incorporates knowledge and power into my mind those tools are really really valuable and it's not only about control it's also about how you can incorporate sensing sensing through Tools in an active way you can sense like using a blind person's ske or an active different sensor that fellow scientists made even just writing in a notebook is so valuable this really expands your mind we want the tools on the right side we want less of the tools on the left side we can create those for a time just to test them out but let's transfer more to the right side so when you look at these tools what are we finding out I just found out that my clock is wrong has been running from the beginning of the session so that I don't know what time I'm at please let me know really offloading intelligence is great but we should be careful what we wish for and there are a bunch of studies we do there is theoretical computer science Basics basic studies that we do and it turns out that by upgrading your machine the theory says we don't get more computer actually we may end up achieving less possible functions than we started with isn't that amazing it's very surprising we're very surprised by those results but this delivers same message we have this control and perception loop right and of course those are both very important and both of those we have to increase the bandwidth with so the basic picture is that you have a self right and you're interacting with something the environment or the AI and you don't want of course you want a tool that mediates and helps you interact with the environment and make Society better but what you want is something that extends yourself right you want more bandwidth more connectivity a more integrated self that is made with the tool like a prosthetic in our research recently with csas we talk about light cone augmenting Technologies and there are many examples in science fiction but we want to pick the right ones that really expand augment the cognitive and caring cell something like Gmail delegation if you have a company you delegate to your employees your team members that's great but you want this to be an extension of yourself where you still sense the end and if you don't know what your employes are doing maybe you're doing it wrong this integration is very important there are physical limitation and we do research on that too there are many constraints and those constraints may come from your substrate your embodiment and maybe the physics that are very different in biology different types of biologies let's say in plants or maybe in Silicon maybe in dominoes you can compute with so many things and each have their own constraints so I want to explore a little bit of that and give you just I'm just giving examples now so you can relax and just enjoy the ride so my picture I usually explain this with is how to meet with an alien it's really like the Sci-Fi picture right and what you're going to find is that it's hard to recover meaning from a different substrate it's even hard when it's human archaeological residue from different cultures that are not so far ago this is the work of from my thesis trying to recover meaning from those Kus and in in the Andes is extremely difficult just a few hundred years ago those are those are pieces of art simulating how we would make the meaning of our own Society now in the future very difficult and arguably alen AI minds are no different I want to insist that there is a Borum for effect in in this in which we think we know what chbt is all about it's very humanlike really I understand everything about it yes it's thinking like a human I I interact with it I know what it's doing well no I call it in a different talk that I'm giving you can find out on YouTube i' call those lovecrafting cherries because yanan says that reinforcement learning has a very cherry on the top here and we're just seeing the cherry on the top this is a monster no judgment it's not a positive or negative monster it's just very different from our own cognitions and we have to recognize that oh I'm out of breath I should slow down a little bit but also speed up because I'm an academic and I have a lot of slides so I think we have tools from computer science and we know that surprisingly we're pretty good at recognizing other agents there are many surprises like that and we took advantage of some of those surprises to trying to investigate that and we made this robot it's a collaboration with our folks at Wasa University here Dominque Chen and colleagues we made a robot in which we put a bunch of microbes turns out we're not very conscious of our surroundings a bit of our families but how about all the viruses bacteria in our guts just around us there are trillion not not thousand not million not it's trillions of individual agents that are around us that form what makes us us and yet we're not very connected to them so we thought let's put some of those in a box make delicious pickles and communicate with them I think sound is not going to come out but anyway this is in Japanese we interact we can actually talk to those robots it translates between micro language to our language I'm skipping the details but basically this uses similar technology to Transformers and language models and turns out the best way so far to interact very deeply with them is to engage in with with them in games and my favorite game is the game of game of Go or different different baduk and so on and also chess it turns out you can feel the personality and emotions from a different creature through a very narrow channel if you design it right so we did do this stuff we also I added this slide because someone mentioned it as a joke probably but actually we do it and I think those tools like jundo very nicely introduced I think we can increase use technology to increase our sense of empathy and if anything this is the most important this teaches us in a very Mentor Way how to extend ourselves and care about others and let's make use of this technology if possible and we are also interested in any Agents so also AI to AI interaction my personal practice actually doesn't come from meditation it comes from when I was a teenager I got into I shared with a few of you it comes from hypnosis and I really got into it and later when I touched on meditation now it's an interpretation of hypnosis to me so this is the tool that I exploited and we made basically a technology that a device like a set of devices that augment somehow Your Capacity to control your own emotions and it is so nice to have had an introduction to my talk basically I feel like yeah this was meant to be that jundo introduced those Concepts and how it's it could be very useful also it's very very very useful also it's very dangerous possibly technology we have to be very careful how you we use it you can modify a lot of things perception sense of agency and we don't only create a technology we do research around it to make sure it's safe you can also use it for simply entertainment and you can modify on the Fly your Netflix movie so that it fits and it puts you in the right mood and doesn't get you too excited before you go to sleep or too worked up in any way you can design basically everything to tune and have a self regulator like a mentor that you would be still sensing through and controlling through if that makes sense we we really want to understand what's the structure of experience while doing that and we think that without having the science of experience we won't find out so we make mathematical theories and try to apply them and back and forth and we think there is no other way and we studed structure of color experience language sound experience all of those I think are very important we shouldn't drop that side of cognitive science while we're making the tools in fact we should have it back and forth all right I'll finish on this now I sped up very nicely all of this is about achieving Harmony and it was the title of my of my talk here there is a conventional transitions incorporation and scientists would say of often that we know everything about love and how it emerg it's artificial it's just designed in your it's it's just designed in your brains and your minds in your bodies in your genes how you are cooperating with each other usually you're cooperating with things that are very similar to you and we start with the left side where you love only thyself but then we might as we build up more complexity and caring complexity in our not only genes but but also technology we have the opportunity to love a bit further and extend extend the kinds of love that we have so how do we do that really we could have reach love as it could be we could reach something that is so this is recent conversations that we had with Mike Levan and others we could reach unconventional and I would say I would ask you does it sound like non love something that reaches Beyond beyond your own embodiment possibly something very far away from something very similar to you that is easy to love can you love something that is further and further and possibly extend your light cone of care to everything and everyone every life form so we study a lot of moral consideration U I guess theories but we also push it towards what we call autopoetic care so you'll find the papers if you if you Google my name and others here and I think we had some introductions from from Thomas and Bill already about the stuff that we do and I just want to end on this that interweaving with technology is going to be very difficult but also it's an adventure we are accepting that we are not this permanent self-defined self forever and that will never change on the contrary we have this opportunity to change ourselves and design our own change and accept that we are not our final form humans are not as they are the center of everything maybe not quite yet but maybe there is something underlying that is more important and we want to be very open-minded about this and really not stop any strand of science that could bring joy happiness but also care and further cognitive development to all of humanity and with that I would like to thank you all it was very fun to have you e ---
