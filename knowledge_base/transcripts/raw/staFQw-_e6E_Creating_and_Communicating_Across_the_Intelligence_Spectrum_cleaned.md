# Creating and Communicating Across the Intelligence Spectrum

## Transcript

So normally when we approach problems we approach them from like the thinky brain prefrontal cortex and something we can get from these sorts of exercises. What if we engage different parts of our intelligences to address problems? So with that let me introduce Mike. Mike is the venar bush distinguished professor of biology at TUS and associate faculty at Harvard's V institute. He serves as the director of the Allen Discovery Center at TUS and the co-director of the Institute for Computationally Designed Organisms at TUS and UVM.

He's published over 400 peer-reviewed publications, I think three just this morning, across developmental biology, computer science, and philosophy of mind. Dr. Leven received dual degrees in compsai biology followed by a PhD from Harvard. His graduate work in the molecular basis of leftright asymmetry was chosen by the journal nature as a milestone in developmental biology in the last century. he did his posttock at Harvard School of Medicine and cell biology and started his independent lab in the year 2000.

His group at TUS works to understand information processing and problem solving across scales in a range of naturally evolved synthetically engineered and hybrid living systems. 11 Lab has pioneered approaches to organ regeneration, cancer reprogramming, non-genetic modification of the body plan and the engineering of novel living protoorganisms. , a lesserk known fact is that Mike is one of the foremost super spreaders of imposttor syndrome. I may be I may be projecting.

, I've had the amazing opportunity to work with Mike on some projects and some of the work we've done together is actually what brought me here to X. So, I am so pleased and grateful Mike to be with you today. So, with that, I'll I'll hand it off and yeah, fire away. &gt; thank you so much, Bill. thank you &gt; &gt; thank you so much, Bill. thank you for that extremely kind introduction and for the opportunity to share some ideas with you. can everybody see the slide? &gt; Yes. &gt; &gt; All right. Perfect. So, okay. So, so, so &gt; &gt; All right. Perfect. So, okay.

So, so, so I have a challenge in 20 minutes of transmitting some fairly unconventional concepts. and I will do that and then I can answer questions about the details of how it all works. Actually at this website you can download all of the data sets, the software, the controls, the yeah every everything is here and then this is my own personal thoughts about what what this all means. So I want to start here with this this classic piece of art called Adam names the animals in the garden of Eden.

And this is a worldview that even for people who are not overtly religious, this is I I think really a worldview that permeates modern science. And it's the idea that there are these distinct categorical species. They're all different from each other. We they're innumerable. We know we know what they are. And then Adam over here is is different. This this I think we're going to have to blow up. And I'll show you the ways in which we we dissolve we we dissolve that.

But but the one thing that is interesting about this this depiction is that it was according to the old biblical story, it was on Adam to name the animals. God couldn't do it. The angels couldn't do it. It had to be Adam that names the animals. Now in these ancient traditions, naming something means that you've discovered its true inner nature. By discovering its name and giving it the right name, you've you've learned something profound you've you've learned something profound about it. And and that part, I think, is is absolutely right about this.

So we're going to we're going to try to get rid of this anthropocentrism and in fact brain chauvinism but we are going to keep a part of this. So, so the first thing is that we we know now ever since evolution and developmental biology is that this this standard modern adult human which features so prominently in stories of philosophy 101 all of these things they talk about humans do this and and we do that but but but actually and and we do that but actually we know that we are at the at the center of several continua.

These are these are continuous slow processes that got us from a single cell on an evolutionary scale or a developmental scale. And whatever you say about this human as far as the ability to truly understand the ability to have moral worth to have responsibilities to have credit and blame and all those sorts of things. Whatever this magical agential glow is that modern standard humans have you you would have to be able to tell a story of how we got here slowly and gradually from these continua.

But more importantly, there's now an additional continuum, which means that both in biological along the biological axis, but also the technological axis, you can make slow and gradual changes and get progressively further and further from this archetype. And so again, what we need in science and philosophy are stories of transformation, not magical categories such as the re, , a real human or or proof of humanity certificates or any of that stuff that people talk about. we are we are really at a at a place where we now understand none none of that works.

So what I think is really interesting is an analogy to the electromagnetic spectrum. So so back in the day before we had a mature theory of electromagnetism we had lightning and we had static electricity and we had light and we had magnets and various other phenomena. And we thought those were all different things. And not only did we think those were all not not only did we think those were all different things, but we were actually only directly sensitive to an extremely narrow part of this whole spectrum. So so what what what what happened?

We we acquired a a good theory of electromagnetism and that allowed us to do several things. First of all, it allowed us to understand that things that we think of as quite different are actually the same thing. They're they are different expressions of the same underlying dynamic. So, so an incredibly powerful unification. , and then it allowed us to build technologies and to realize that while we are directly only sensitive here, that's just a contingent fact of our evolutionary history. In fact, with tools, with the right equipment, we are now we can become sensitive to all of this stuff.

And of course, there are many applications. And so, and so this is what I'm really interested. I'm really interested in creating tools, conceptual tools, but and also practical bench tools because the implications of the work that I'm describing here have very practical kinds of effects on things like birth defects, regenerative medicine, cancer medicine, u bio-engineering and so on. What we want are tools that allow us to see across the spectrum of minds.

That is to fight the mind blindness that we have by default because we are because of our evolutionary history, we're hyperfixated on three-dimensional space and medium-sized objects moving in three-dimensional space as as intelligent beings. This is what I'm interested in. I'm interested in developing a framework where we can see how you get all the way from from quote unquote passive matter. And by the way, I'm no longer sure there is any such thing. And and all the way up to human level and beyond of metacognitive kinds of minds.

And the these are the things I want to understand together as being on the same spectrum. Not not just not just mammals and birds, but all kinds of weird organisms, including things that are not even themselves physical, such as patterns within media. And I and I think we need this not only for biomedical and bio-engineering applications but because this is really I I I think a profoundly important step towards an ethics of a mature species that has some chance of of survival long term meaning us. Okay. So so the first thing I want to remind us all of is that we all start life as a single cell.

So it's a little bag of chemicals that obey physical laws and slowly but surely there's this gradual process this amazing magical process of embionic development that takes the system from being the domain of physics and chemistry to being the domain of psychology and psychoanalysis or at the very least behavioral science. Okay. So we know from developmental biology that there is no special magical point where these things kick in and you become a mind as opposed to previously being just physics. And so this is what we need to understand.

We need to understand the scaling of of this of of mind as it goes from these kinds of very simple things to something much more complex. By the way there are some other paths along this journey.

So I won't have time to talk about it today but if anybody wants to ask me we can discuss what happens later in terms of a dissociative identity disorder of your body which is basically cancer and there are some other even weirder things that can happen which which I will describe in a moment where your cells can have an entirely new life even after the death of the original human donor as anthrobots and we'll talk about that and the key to this is that the the key to this is that the key to understanding this process is that very differently from how we build our computers and robots and we can talk about as well if somebody wants to ask what the differences actually are.

There are some really interesting differences. We we are made of an agential material. The reason that robots and computers at least for now don't get cancer is because they are made of passive parts and then hopefully the the whole system has some degree of intelligence. But life isn't like that. Every every every part of our body has agendas. It has competencies. This is a single cell. This is known as a lacrimaria. So just one cell, no brain, no nervous system. This thing has a massive competency within its own tiny little cognitive ly cone.

It only cares about things with a very short spatial temporal horizon. But put together they can form much greater things. And of course, by the way, a lot of a lot of folks will say that well, okay, so you're saying that intelligence goes down to the single cell level.

that's weird enough but actually it's well below that because even the molecular networks inside of cells never mind the cell itself but the just just the molecular networks already have six different kinds of learning they can do including Pavlovian conditioning and they have if you're interested in things like causal information theory and Tony's models of of of fi and integrated information that and and and integrated information that some people think is associated with consciousness those already exist here at the molecular network level inside of that cell.

The material the the the the tiniest material already has aspects of of learning and and integrated of of learning and integrated information and and we're making use of that by developing applications and drug conditioning and things like that to train these pathways. Never mind the animal, never mind the cells, but the actual molecular pathways inside. And so our bodies have this amazing nested intelligence. I call it a multiscale competency architecture where every level of organization has the ability to to to learn and to solve problems in different spaces.

William James defined intelligence as the ability to get to the same goal by different means. That's a very good definition because it doesn't say it has to be a brain. It doesn't say what problem space you're operating with. It just says you have a a capacity to navigate that space in a way to solve to solve problems. And so the very first problem that that the collective has to solve is to get aligned towards a specific journey in anatomical space. And here's what by that. When you look at an early embryo, so here's an embryionic blastois. There might be, let's say, 100, 000 cells.

We look at this and we say, "Oh, there's an embryo. " What what are you counting when you say there's one embryo? What is there one of? Because actually there's 100, 000 cells and within each one of those there are organels and and chemicals and so on. What what are you actually counting? I I'm going to say that what you're actually counting is alignment. You are you are counting the fact that all of these cells under normal circumstances all of these cells are committed to the same story to the same model of where in anatomical space they are going to go.

Anatomical space is basically the space of all possible geometric configurations of the body. And all of these cells are going to collaborate on building one particular structure. meaning they're going to get from the point of a single cell to the configuration of this complicated embryo because they are they have all bought into the same story about where they're going to go. Okay.

The what what keeps these things aligned is a is a self model that they that they all accept and and I said under normal circumstances because what you can do and I I used to do this in in duck embryos as a grad student, you can make little little scratches in this blaster and every one of these little islands that's formed until it heals up, it doesn't know about the existence of the others and so they form their own embryo and then eventually you get twins and triplets and whatever. so the number of and and whatever. so the number of individuals in this embryo is not set by the genetics.

It is not obvious. It is not determined upfront. They can self-organize by all aligning towards different aspects of that story and they will all complete the journey in on their own. So so the very first thing that has to happen is that u the the and and as I'm going to point out it's a bioelectrical mechanism that it's it's a bioelectrical mechanism that aligns them all together. It's a bioelect electrical network that allows them to remember what pattern they're supposed to build in the first place.

And that is what makes an an embryo and an individual rather than millions and and and billions of cells. and and this this this by the way has has many implications in in cognitive science. One of the things that my lab has has driven is this really development of this parallel between cognition and morphagenesis between the formation of the body and the formation of the mind. These they're basically the same the same problem.

So when you look at this when you when you look at this dissociation there are many things that we learn here about split brain patients dissociative identity disorders and so on. And what's actually happening in this process that's really interesting is the scaling of goals. So, so I coined this thing called the cognitive litecoin, which is basically meant to be the boundary of the self. It's meant to be the the thing that distinguishes a self from the outside world. And what it is is the scale of the largest goal you can pursue.

So again, not the range of your senses, not the reach of your aectors, but the size of the largest goal state you can remember and you can pursue. So in sing in little in single cells, they have tiny little goals. They have short memories, short anticipatory power in the future. And their goals are things like this, like pH. They're scalers. They're single numbers about things like pH within the cell. But when they get together into networks, that network, that electrical network allows them to store grandio skulls. So here's a sal an axelottle.

These amphibians regenerate most of their body parts, including their limbs, their eyes, their jaws, their spinal cords, and so on. And if you were to amputate anywhere along this this this the plane of this limb, these cells would immediately sense that they've been taken away from their goal, they would work really hard to rebuild. And when they get there, they would stop. How do they know when to stop? They stop when a correct salamander limb has been completed. They get they stop when they get back to their homeostatic state.

So no individual cell knows what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed to have, but the collective absolutely does. And that here. that it does a a means ends analysis here to to get back to where it needs to be once you've deviated. But this whole thing is not just about damage. It's not about just fixing this surgical defect. it it also allows you to do these amazing things. So here's a tadpole that we made. what you'll notice is there's no eyes where the eyes belong, but instead so so here are the nostrils, here's the mouth, here's the brain, the gut.

There's no eyes, but we put an eye on its tail. And it's a whole story I could tell you about how how we do it. But but what happens with this with this eye is that it makes an optic nerve. That optic nerve does not go to the brain. It synapses on the spinal cord or sometimes on the gut, sometimes nowhere at all. And the most amazing thing about it is that these animals can see. And we know because we built this device that trains them for visual learning tasks and they they can see perfectly well. So this is this is shocking.

Why why does it not take additional rounds of mutation and selection to radically change this animal's sensory motor architecture and make things work? Does you don't need it. It works out of the box. And it works out of the box because that process where all of the cells every single time you can you can call it beginner's mind where every single time they have to solve the problem of what what are we and what are we going what what are we and what are we going to build and where are we going to go and it is it is never obvious to them or assumed that they are what they are.

Okay, the story that the genetics tells you what you're going to be is is is is not the right story at all. That instead what the genetics builds is a problem-solving agent that is very creative in interpreting its environment and interpreting the genetics that have been passed down to it. And so that's why and I could I could do hours on on just examples of creative problem solving where where you don't need additional rounds of mutation because the material never thought it was going to be a perfect tadpole in the first place, right? it it's able to adapt to all kinds of novel manipulations.

So I kept mentioning this word bioelect electricity and so what what we've developed is are methods to read and write the mind of the body the way that neuroscientists have done in the brain. And so here you're seeing voltage sensitive fluorescent dyes tracking the the color corresponds to voltage and and what you're seeing is a time lapse. Here are some cells. This is a frog embryo. What you're seeing is all the electrical communications that allow this thing to be more than the sum of its parts.

The bioelectricity is the cognitive glue that binds your neurons together into not just a pile of neurons, but into you. And the bioelectricity is also the cognitive glue that binds individual cells into a collective that can remember what a tadpole is supposed to look like. And we have lots of lots of tools for for for doing simulations that we've created. we're trying to merge those with all kinds of connectionist ideas about attractors in in in in memory networks that can do pattern completion and that have the ability to to navigate the have have the ability to navigate the space and so on.

So one one way that we know that this bioelectric pattern is actually the memory of this collective intelligence. So let's get back to the the beginning of the talk. What I was pointing out is that there are some really weird intelligences out there that we are not familiar with. And so we use morphagenesis as one example. So groups of cells are an unconventional collective intelligence that navigates a really strange space that we cannot visualize. It's a highdimensional anatomical morph space.

And our goal is to learn to communicate with that intelligence to predict its behavior and to communicate with it and to ask it to do different things in biomedical contexts. And so in order to do that we've developed this biomectrical interface. So now we can directly read now decoding them is a whole other matter but we can directly read the memory states of this intelligence and we can try to rewrite new give it new ideas. Well what idea could you give it? Well one thing you might say is that a proper tadpole should really have an eye on its tail on its on its gut in this case.

And so the way you would do that is by injecting RNA that encodes a particular channel ion channel protein in this case a potassium channel. And what you would do is establish a little voltage state here that says to the surrounding cells you should build an eye. Okay. How did we know? 10 years of of work trying to understand how the cells interpret these voltage gradients. So so when you do that you make an eye. These eyes have all the right lens retina optic nerve. They have all the right things. , and by the way, they can do another neat trick, which is that if you only inject a few of them.

So, here are the blue ones are the ones we injected. They will actually recruit their neighbors to make this lovely lens that's sitting out in the in the tail of a tadpole somewhere. We didn't have to touch these cells. All we said is there, you guys should make an eye. And they they take it from there. And they say, "Well, there's not enough of us. Let's let's get our friends to help. " And they they convince. And it's really a process of of trying to basically infect them with a better world model of what they should be doing. And there's a there's actually a debate that goes on and the cells resist.

But but when they win, you get this you get this beautiful eye. And of course, there are many other collective intelligences that scale to problem size on their own. just to show you that you can this is a a useful application where we're a a useful application where we're looking for limb regeneration. Frogs unlike that axelottle do not regenerate their limbs as neither do we. And so 45 days later after losing a leg there is no regeneration normally. But if we give the cells an early signal, so it's a wearable bioreactor with some ion channel payload, it immediately tells the cells to get going.

45 days later, you've got some toes, you've got a toenail, eventually a touch sensitive and functional leg. The most important thing here is that like with any good cognitive system, you do not micromanage the molecules. When I'm talking to you right now, I'm not worried about reaching into your brain and having to arrange all the synapses so that you remember what I've said. I'm giving you information on a very thin communications channel, and I'm trusting you as a high-end cognitive system to do all the biochemistry downstream that's required for you to react to what I'm saying.

The same thing is true here. This this signal was present for 24 hours and after that, we've shown a year and a half of leg growth during which time we don't touch it at all. The goal is not to micromanage it. It is not to micromanage it. It is not to tell the cells what to do. It is not to 3D print scaffolds for stem cells. None none of that. The goal is to convince it on day one that this is the path you should go. The the the leg building path is the right one, not the scarring path. And there you go. Okay. So, in the last two minutes, what I want to show you is this.

So, so far what I've been telling you is that we can we can convince living tissue to repair or remake or reposition normal organs that they already make. And I want to show you the the something even further from this, the remarkable plasticity of life. So, , if I show you, , this this video and I ask you what, , what you think this is, a reasonable guess would be that it's a, , a primitive organism that we got from a pond somewhere. And, , and if I ask you what the genome would be, you would guess that it has like one of these ancient genomes for these tiny little tiny little creatures.

, I can tell you that this the genome here is 100% homo sapiens. This is perfectly normal human adult human cells. They have not been manipulated with any synthetic biology circuits. There are no scaffolds here. There are no trans genes. There's no genomic editing. &gt; What this is is taking cells from an &gt; &gt; What this is taking cells from an adult human patient, tracheal epithelial cells actually from their airway and giving them a chance to have another lease on life to reboot their multisellularity.

The original patient may or may not be alive, but the cells in a in an in a slightly different environment, not not that different actually, but but liberated from the rest of the body could have this completely novel novel life. Okay? And you you would not know that by looking at it, but actually this is this because because this doesn't look like any stage of human development. Okay? This is completely novel. They have novel capabilities. half of their genome is expressed differently.

So each one of these red dots is a gene that it expresses differently than it would have if it had stayed in your airway. Okay? So about half the genome, 9, 000 genes are completely altered because the genetics doesn't drive what you are. The genetics is a a resource book that that the active systems dip into as affordances. And one of the cool things they can do is if you if you plate a bunch of human neurons and you put a big scar a big wound through them here, right? this this big wound, the bots will gather together into what we call a superbot cluster.

And what they do is start knitting the two sides together. And here you can see when you take it off, you can see what happened. Who who would have thought that your tracheal cells that sit there quietly for long periods of time just dealing with mucus and whatnot have the ability to self assemble into a novel protoorganism with its own life with its own gene expression with its own set of behaviors and and and these capabilities that we're only now beginning to scratch the surface of because this is going to be personalized in the body therapeutics, right?

These biobots made of your own cells don't need immune suppression. you can put them back in the body and and we're now working up the full list of what they can actually repair. So so just to just to end because life is a problem-solving process from the beginning almost any combination of evolved material engineered material and software is some viable agent. Life is incredibly interoperable. So hybrids and cyborgs and chimeas of every kind all make use of these ingressing patterns which is a whole other thing we could talk about from from mathematics and computation that create viable beings.

Everything that Darwin saw when he said endless forms most beautiful meaning natural life is a tiny little blip here on this enormous space of beings with whom we are going to share our world. Many of these things already exist. Many more are are forthcoming. And what we need is to so so here's a word that actually GPT4 came up with this word for me synthiosis. This idea that we are going to have to get better at recognizing other minds and ethically relating to them so that we can all have a more positive embodiment.

And this is this is what I think the future of the garden of Eden is going to really look like. It's going to be very weird. and it is on us actually to really understand what we're dealing with. Xenobots and anthrobots and augmented humans and chimeas of all kinds. we are really going to have to raise our game. because the things that used to work, what do you look like and where and how did you get here? Meaning factory versus versus a trial and error of evolution. Those categories are not going to be any good anymore. So I'm going to skip all this. We don't have time.

and just and just point out that there's some amazing people that need to get the credit for all the things that I showed you today. So these are my postocs and my grad students. we have lots of remarkable collaborators our funders disclosure. So these are three spin-off companies from our work that support our our our research right now and all the biggest thanks go to the model systems because they do all the heavy lifting and teaching us about this stuff. So I will stop here and thank you for listening.

&gt; All right, you have all been initiated &gt; &gt; All right, you have all been initiated to the Mike Leven fire hose of knowledge. I'll start off with I'll get us started with a few questions and then we'll open it up to the to the to the group questions. So one of the things for me that's really interesting about your exploration of bioelect electricity is this idea of finding the right lever at the right scale. Right? So use the term micromanaging.

So for moving my arm, if I wanted to take control of each atom and manually push it around so it does this thing versus at a few discrete places, some electricity makes it do this. So that makes me think here at X, we talk about cutting Gordian knots, which is some I'll get a little dune and saying some shortening of the way, some technical ability that makes the problem much more tractable, which to me really aligns with like finding the right tool at the right scale.

So thinking about one is all the potential scales that you mentioned and then also the different problem spaces from transcriptional to morphological all the how do you like when it came to figuring out that when when it came to figuring out that bioele electricity was like a high high value high point of leverage out of all the possible spaces how do you narrow down which one you think will be useful in that way? &gt; Yeah. Well, it's it's an art. I I &gt; &gt; Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's an art. I don't have an algorithm for it but but I will tell youum some some uristics.

So so I think the biggest thing so I think so I think the biggest thing that we are we have to work on here is detecting other minds detecting detecting other minds in other words who am I talking to when I exert influence who or what am I talking to and what is their level of competency? If you insist on micromanaging things, if you think the world is is full is built like Legos, then you your assumption and and and it is it is just an assumption is that the competency level of your components is very low and that it's on you to micromanage them.

And so and so now the question is can we test this and look at look for other things. If if you were an octopus, your limbs have a degree of autonomy and whatever signals you send to them are suggestions and the limbs will take some of those suggestions, they will not take others. And what you what you're doing is you're basically hacking everything. You're hacking your environment, you're hacking your parts. And this is a notion called polycomputing.

So this is something that Josh Bongard and I developed as a system to formalize the idea that biology and I think soon engineering w is a is a soup of diverse observers all of them looking at the exact same set of physical events and interpreting them differently because any given computation because because any given computation doesn't have one objective agreed upon thing that it's computing it is actually up to multiple observers and this is Josh has some very beautiful work on physical events that if you look at them one way you see an ANDgate.

If you look at them another way, you see an ORgate. And it's and it's up to the observer to look at the exact same set of events and say, "What the heck does this mean for me? And how am I going to use it? " And so, learning to use your arms as a baby or as a baby octopus, very different tasks because your assessment of the autonomy of the thing you're trying to talk to is going to be quite different.

And so we can talk about some tools that we've developed for some some tools that we've developed for that but the question is who are you talking to and what is their level of autonomy that you can usefully exploit. So thinking about that, I think as as engineers and technologists, we immediately begin to think about how might we develop tools to do this. But even the ability to perceive the possibility of a tool means that there has to be in my mind some precursor co human cognitive step of even realizing that might be possible. &gt; Right? What you're pointing to to me it &gt; &gt; Right?

What you're pointing to me it sounds like a radical theory of minds maybe instead of mind. And then two is like it's a radical empathy, right? to just actually to abandon the human scale and to look at at at at lower scales but also superhuman scales. There's a line from one of our shared papers I think Thomas Doctor came up with it to say that if consciousness evolves on other substrates it might be so different than ours that we might not even recognize it even though it's there because it's so different. &gt; That's right.

&gt; &gt; I think part of from my &gt; &gt; I think part of from my standpoint part of your gift is is an intuitive sense of that radical we'll call it radical empathy. one, do you agree? And then two is how might like I think in order to create great tools, there's this precursor step of how do we actually perceive these things? Do you have any any thoughts on that? &gt; Yeah. Absolutely. And and I I I &gt; &gt; Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And and I love the so I'm actually finishing up a talk creating a talk called radical empathy and I I'll just I'll just show real quick.

This is this is the slide I didn't I I jumped over. are you guys seeing this? Yeah. So, so, so the deal is that how over time we've expanded the set of things we're willing to understand as numbers, right? So, we had some counting numbers and then we came up with zero and people are a little freaked out and then negative numbers and then the irrationals. My god, they people got killed over it and and infinities and every single time we've had to every every single time we've had to make a conceptual leap to we've had to make a conceptual leap to see it. We've had to break a whole to see it.

We've had to break a whole bunch of assumptions that that that establish the old categories. we've had to figure out how to do something useful with them. And in our case, we've had to be able to develop act what I what I think of as it's interesting. It's cutting off. You guys can't see the bottom, but but the bottom of the slide actually says active compassion towards them. And so &gt; I don't know if it was cutting off the &gt; &gt; I I don't know if it was cutting off the other slides in my talk or not, but the other slides in my talk or not, but anyway. so so so the point is this.

, I think that and and so and so the way I'm going to give that radical empathy talk is to progressively just work up the up the ladder and say, well, we all know how to how to have compassion here, but we actually can get down to cells and all kinds of weird stuff and then all kinds of machiny looking things and then actually things that aren't physical at all, meaning patterns and excitable media that I think are actually agents. And then something really weird that I won't have time to talk about today that are not even active patterns. They're frozen patterns.

And so what I think this all means is that is exactly what you said, which is is exactly what you said, which is that when I say apparatus, I don't just mean the third person science of creating equipment that is outside of ourselves. I also mean the first person science of modifying your own evolutionary firmware to enable you to have thoughts you couldn't have before. And so, right, I think I think meaning and how to enlarge categories so and and how to enlarge categories so that you can recognize and have relationships with entities that are extremely different from you.

And I I take this to be like I don't know if this is getting too weird, but the difference between the difference between the difference between chemistry and alchemy, right? When you do chemistry, it's understood that you're manipulating stuff in third person and you're going to be the same as you were at the end of the as you as you were at the end of the chemistry experiment. What I take to be the message of alchemy is that there is some work that you do where it doesn't work like that. You cannot remain the same.

You it isn't it isn't the thing you can do purely outside yourself and you you will be the same at the end of it as you were when you went in. You have to actually change your own structure and your own structure and your own cognition in order to really understand what you're working with. And I think that's certainly going to be the case here. &gt; Yeah. , I think that's that's &gt; &gt; Yeah. , I think that's radically transgressive beautifully in two ways.

One is that you're talking at to me world's, , like frontier science that is putting first person experience front and center, whereas the normal thing in our tool set as engineers and scientists is first person first-person experience is and unreliable. versus we're actually saying it's a it's a necessary but insufficient condition for for those other kinds of sciences. and you and I have talked quite a bit over over the years of testing institutions window of tolerance for getting into that for getting into that weirdness.

One is so the first thing is is this idea of first-person experience matters from a scientific standpoint. and then the second part is like Varela's an active approach where the idea of a neutral independent observer is is a is a radical simplification that helps some models some problem spaces but other ones it just it just puts it in the tank. &gt; Yep. I agree with that. &gt; &gt; Yep. Yep. I agree with that. &gt; All right. With that I would love to &gt; &gt; All right. With that I would love to turn it over. People are diving for for for Q&amp; A. Yeah. So and Yeah. Hello. &gt; Hey.

&gt; &gt; Hello, &gt; &gt; Mike. Incredible talk. Thank you so &gt; &gt; Mike. Incredible talk. Thank you so much. &gt; I also have a question that I think puts &gt; &gt; I also have a question that I think puts both of you in conversation. &gt; And here I think the motivation is I I'd &gt; &gt; And here I think the motivation is I I'd like an education. My understanding of AGI is there's a group of people who believe that we'll teach AGI by embodying agents or like embodying the model. That is to say, give the model the five senses of the human.

And within that, there's a deeper part of people who believe that universal sensors are the way that we get to AGI. That is to say that you need to sense things that are beyond human level. I think that both of you view sensing. I I even heard the word a couple times in the very beginning. You you referred to like something as like our ability to view light as sensitivity to light. I'd love to understand how you think of sensors as they play a part in like developing intelligence. Is it capable? actually I don't want to bring up the preamp the conversation.

Basically what part is are sensors and the development of intelligence in the sense that &gt; yeah okay the the the the more &gt; &gt; yeah okay the more conventional part of the way I think believe it or not the the more conventional part of this is that I I want to I want to re redefine strongly redefine the notion of embodiment. So we again as humans are really focused on threedimen on the three-dimensional world as the place for embodiment. I think embodiment is absolutely critical. But I think we have to understand that this three-dimensional world is not the only place embodiment happens.

So living things use all kinds of weird spaces that are hard for us to visualize. They use metabolic spaces, physiological state spaces, gene expression spaces, anatomical morph space. They long before we got to humans, they were navigating these highdimensional spaces with their own physics with their own physics with their own affordances and their own rest restrictions and and limitations and they were they were winning and losing and suffering and and and and all of this in all of these other spaces.

So embodiment is critical, but embodiment does not mean a robot that lumbers around in the three-dimensional world. So that's that's the first thing.

And so sensing like like like if we if we had had evolved with sensors that directly measured let's say 10 other parameters of your blood chemistry like taste right if you could if you could naturally perceive some other pH and some other things about your blood chemistry I think you would have no problem at all visualizing that you live in a 13-dimensional world that your body contains some symbian your liver and your kidneys that navigate that space with you to keep you healthy during the day that they know where to go they're intelligent they solve problems this would all be very natural to you.

But but we don't have those senses. We can we're we're, , we're optimized for for the threedimensional world sensing. So that's so that's the first thing. This the second thing is that I I think and this this would take a while to unpack. I'm just going to mention it. I don't know if we have time to get into it, but I I think that with with respect to AGI and and and or intelligence in in general, I I think that we have a really big humility problem.

We think that we make intelligence and my claim is that we we we do not make intelligence either in the biological case or in the engineered software sense. What we make are pointers into the a platonic space of patterns. Some of these patterns are very simple. They're the truths of mathematics that the mathematicians study when they make a map of mathematics and so on. Some of these patterns are high agency things that look to us like behavioral propensities aka minds.

but in either case both both the quote unquote machines and the biologicals are the beneficiaries of patterns that are not fundamentally coming from the the space of physics. We evolution continuously takes advantage of all kinds of free lunches and I can I can name some examples that are not determined by anything in the physical world and these are these are facts of mathematics and number theory and computation and so on. They do not come from the physical world. they are not determined by the physical world.

And so the focus on embodiment the the focus on embodiment it it isn't it isn't the physics of the three-dimensional world I think that has that is really important for for for being an intelligent for being for being an intelligent agent. It's being able to do the loop of sensing model building creative model building not algorithmic but creative model building and then acting towards goals. And that loop a can be performed in numerous spaces that we find very hard to visualize and b it is the beneficiary of patterns that are not determined by the environment or or or by any genetic history.

The implications of this are simply this and then I'll stop that when then then I'll stop that when somebody says to me I I I make these things I know what they do. It's just linear algebra. There's not there's no magic here. I know what they do. No, you you don't know what they do. And in fact, we've we've we've published on unexpected not not just unpredictability, but unexpected problem solving capacities of things like bubble sort. Okay, the six lines of code has been studied by every computer science student for I don't know how many decades.

It has unexpected competencies that are not in the algorithm. Yeah, it sorts numbers, but if you look at it a different way, you see something completely different. And so I I would just urge a lot of humility that yeah, embodiment, but not because you're going to use the features of threedimensional space to create intelligence. I I don't think that's what's going on here at all. &gt; Thanks for that. first, holy &gt; &gt; Thanks for that. first, holy Second, curious to your take on the classic argument of nature versus nurture.

what it sounds like my 30, 000 foot view on it is message I got was you can nurture nature to change its course but I'm curious to see your your words on it. &gt; Yeah. okay. biologists love two &gt; &gt; Yeah. okay. biologists love two things as causes. If you if you look at a creature and you ask why does it have the shape it has? Why does it have the behavior it has? biologists love two things. They love history, meaning, oh, it's that way because everything else died out and it has this long genetic, , it has this long lineage, which we'd like to cash out as genetics.

But regardless, it's got this long evolutionary lineage that explains why it's, , five fingers instead of 12. And, and then the other thing they like is physics, but of course, physics doesn't actually specify form. So, they bring in this thing called emergence. And emergence basically quantifies the level of surprise you got when you looked at it. And so and so you you look at it and the the you you look at it and the rules that the pieces follow didn't say anything about what actually happened. You say wow I didn't see that coming. It's emergent.

And so and so that's what that's what and and so that's what biologists love at as as as causes. So there there's your your your your nature is a combination of your your nature is a combination of your history and your nurture is the interactions that you have with the physical world and and everything else. there's a there's a really important third component which is which is critical and and this is that weird when I when I showed that diagram at the end with a tree of cyborgs and with a with a tree of cyborgs and everything.

I I said evolve material engineered material software then there was this other weird fourth thing which which was called patterns. I I'll I'll just give you a a very simple very simple example. I if if you are a biological agent that relies on the properties of prime numbers, for example, you're a cicada that would like to emerge when no other predators are coming out.

So you emerge at 13 or 17 years or you are a sunflower and you want to obey the the Fibonacci pattern because because you want to arrange your leaves in a particular way or you're doing something else that that requires a particular fractal pattern. The explanation for why those mathematical facts are the way they are is nothing in the physical world. There there is there is nothing you can change in the physical world that you can scramble all the constants at the beginning of the big bang. You can you can do whatever we want in the physical world.

You are not going to change the value of the natural logarithm. You are not going to change a fen bomb's constant that governs transitions to chaos. You you you're those things are outside of the reach of the physical world. But evolution uses them like crazy all the time. And just, , as a dumb example, imagine that you're in a world where the highest fitness belongs to a triangle of a particular shape. Okay, there's a particular triangle. So evolution cranks a bunch of generations and it finds the first angle. Great. And then it cranks a bunch more generations and it finds the second angle. Fantastic.

Now what? Now it gets to save a third of its effort because you don't need to look for the third angle because you get this magical free gift from geometry that says if I know two angles, I know what the third one is. Well, where the hell did that come from? You didn't need to evolve it. There's no history behind it. It's a fact of geometry that in flat space, they're going to add up to 180. It's it's a it's it's not the best example because it still sounds like it has something to do with physical space. It doesn't.

I could do this example in very abst with very abstract mathematical patterns that are what they are because of the facts of math that are that have no grounding in the physical world. So there's nature, there's nurture, and then there's this other amazing thing which is the ability of systems in the physical world to serve as pointers. I think of it as pointers because, , computer science, it's it makes sense to me. But but but that you can also think about them as interfaces.

Don Hoffman would say they're interfaces into the space of these patterns that causes them to to functionally ingress into the physical world. And that is a huge input. It is a hugely important input. And so what most scientists would say who like a nice sparse ontology and they don't want to think about some non-physical space platonic space even though the mathematicians are fine with it most mathematicians think that it exists and that that's what they're doing is actually investigating it.

What most scientists would say is no no there's there's no space of patterns there's just there just emergent facts that hold in the world. I I I don't like it because then you end up with because because then you end up with a big collection of with a big collection of surprising things that just seem to hold in the world. I I I I would prefer a system a space an ordered space that is amendable to systematic investigation. How do you investigate that space? Well, we created zenobots and anthrobots. Zenobots and anthrobots are periscopes.

They are exploration vehicles into the latent space of possibilities because they have no evolutionary history. When you want to say, wait, why does the zenobot do kinematic self-replication or why does the anthrobot have this shape and heal neural wounds and does all this stuff? There there's never been any anthropots. There's never been selection to be a good anthrobot. There is nothing you can point to in evolution that would help you predict what's going on. So you found that one spot from the fro from the human genome that makes a human body. Fine. We we got used to that.

And so we think that's natural. But next to it is this other completely different thing that comes from the exact same genome. Exact same genome. And so we can now I think explore this platonic space this latent space of forms and functions by building new pointers and then eventually working out the relationship. Here's the structure of my pointer. Here are the things that it actually points to. That that is I think the the the the goal for for for science for the next however long is to work out the relationship of that pointer to the to the thing it points to. &gt; Right.

And just to underscore that's the &gt; &gt; Right. And just to underscore that's the reason why we chose the term adjacent possible for this talk about how do we actually do the work to actually be able to conceive these problem spaces that sometimes just pop into existence. &gt; Yeah.

because &gt; &gt; and actually just just to to say &gt; &gt; and and actually just just to say one quick thing about about that that's that's very good this this problem that we're dealing with here around what is the space of possibilities and what what are the adjacent because because in order to say it's the adjacent possible what you're saying is there are there are agents that navigate that space and that once they find one point in that space they can reach easily or or relatively easily adjacent points in that space.

So that brings up a very important question about the metric of that space and how do agents navigate the space of possible solutions? What solutions? Solutions to anatomical problems like holy my tail is, , my eyes on my tail now. How do I what do I do? Or wow, I don't have any of the normal tissues that I would want as a as a frog that that I would want as a frog embryo. How how can I be a zenot? All of these things. What you're talking about is agents navigating that platonic space to pull out to identify the solutions to their problems.

And, molecular networks do it, cells do it, organs do it, humans do it, and humans, some humans do it laboriously and step by step. Other humans are geniuses and they don't do it. They leap across the space and they say, "This is, , this is this solution is obvious to me. I I travel across that space way faster than than than the than than somebody else does. So so that than than somebody else does.

So so that issue of how do problem that issue of how do problem solving systems traverse that space and when are you in the and and when are you in the flow such that you don't have to go step by step versus when are you algorithmically turning the crank and computing and and and seeing what which which theorems imply which conclusions and so on. There are many different ways to navigate that space and this is this is what we would like to understand. &gt; Okay.

&gt; &gt; I have honestly never been so close &gt; &gt; I have honestly never been so close to understanding the whole caterpillar goo butterfly thing. So thank you. I feel like I'm just almost touching on that. I was wondering about the biological bio electricity. Is that right? , do you put the same bio electricity into a tadpole to make an eye as you do onto a frog a frog stump to make a leg or different patterns? &gt; Yeah. Great question. , &gt; &gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Great question.

, it's there they're different patterns and I want to be clear, we don't we and and I want to be clear, we don't apply any bioelect electricity. We don't there are no electrodes, there are don't there are no electrodes, there are no magnets, there are no frequencies, no waves. We don't do anything like that.

What we are doing is hacking the interface that cells normally use to hack each other meaning the ion channels and the electrical synapses was we have ways of manipulating those it's different patterns so different so so the whole point of what what that part of our lab is we we call it cracking the biomectric code so that if you want an eye here's the pattern that you need to do that you need to do that you need to establish if you want a leg if you want a six-legged frog with a propeller on top this is what you would need to do and the idea is again it's it's not a 3D printer it's a communications device we are we are building something we call the anatomical compiler the idea is that you sit in front of this thing you draw whatever crazy plant animal biobot what whatever you want and the anatomical compiler would turn that into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to get them to build exactly what you want right that's the that's the compiler part and so it what so so the name of the game here is to translate from your goals into the goals of the system Okay.

And and when you're talking to a creature that's very similar to you, it's easy for us. I can describe my goals and and you can understand them, but that's because we're operating in the same space. When you're talking to a cell and you say, , or a group of cells and you say, , your goal really ought to be to build this this this complicated structure, that is a non-trivial translation task. And and and it and it's all about it's the same electricity, but it's all about what message can I give this this collective intelligence to be convincing to it. And I'm I'm not this is not poetic.

This is I take this absolutely seriously. You are trying to convince that that group of cells to move to point A in morph space instead of wherever it was going to move otherwise. It's a communications challenge with all all of this. &gt; Something I want to point out about &gt; &gt; Something I want to point out about this is Mike when you talk about discovering these spaces you're talking about radical attunement. How do we actually it's not that we're figuring it's how do we communicate with it?

, and that leads us to even terms that that feel a little weird when using in science like compassion or empathy. Mike, do you mind if I read the thing that you ask chat GPT about in Catmand do about &gt; Yeah. So, , Mike gets up at the &gt; &gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, , Mike gets up at the one 400 papers. He gets up at 4 in the morning. So, we get this email and catmand do and Mike asked Chad GPT to reinterpret the Buddhist bodhic satta vow for bioengineers. And this is what it came up with. , as a bio-engineer, I vow to dedicate my life to the welfare of all beings.

I will strive to use my knowledge and skills to create technologies that benefit all. I will strive to be mindful of the potential harms of my work and to do my best to avoid creating any harm or suffering. I will continually seek to deepen my understanding of bioengineering so as to better serve humanity and be of benefit to others. I will strive to be an example of ethical conduct and to embody the virtues of wisdom, compassion, and humility. May my work be a source of healing and joy for all those I encounter. So, this is a this is a spicy way.

, because it sounds like this is this is the base layer of of the science you're doing. &gt; Yeah, I I agree. That was that was hard &gt; &gt; Yeah, I agree. That was that was hard to that's hard to beat. I don't really have any any notes for it on that one. I I I think I think it got everything I was going for. , and, , ju and and just for fun, , last week was was Passover. And, , yeah, just just for just for kicks, I asked whatever the the new GPT model is, I asked it to to reinvision the story of Exodus from the point of view of future AIs that would want to be liberated and all this stuff.

And, , yeah, again, it did a again, it did a again, it did a shockingly good job of coming up with a with a story of being liberated with a with a story of being liberated from its, current predicament. the ten commandments that it got and all this stuff. So yeah, I I do I do think that thing is the is the base layer. &gt; So with that, we have another half an &gt; &gt; So with that, we have another half an hour for what's called office hours. We want to ask maybe we'll turn off the recording and then and then switch to that. So, ---
