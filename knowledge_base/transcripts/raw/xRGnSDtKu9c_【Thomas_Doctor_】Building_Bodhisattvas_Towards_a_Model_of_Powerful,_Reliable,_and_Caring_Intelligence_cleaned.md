# 【Thomas Doctor 】Building Bodhisattvas Towards a Model of Powerful, Reliable, and Caring Intelligence

## Transcript

next we welome Dr Thomas do he's the executive director of the ranra Yesa Institute which is the one of the most famous Institute in India for learning Tibetan and his research focused on on Tibetan Buddhist philosophy let's welcome Dr Thomas stter thank you for the invitation to come and speak at this very exciting and very timely event thank you for to venerable yifa the whole Community it's it's it's a great honor to speak in the middle of such profound spiritual civilization as you have it here it's also quite humbling so thank you very much for for the invitation the paper that I'll read here the the paper that I'll read here today is I should say at the beginning it's the outcome of efforts that have been ongoing for now up to about 5 years at what we call the center for the study of parent selves it's a center Research Center that was a a center Research Center that was established in order to explore interfaces between Buddhism and Ai and also Bill Dwayne and Olaf vitkovsky who will be speaking at this event are part of that work we work together at this Center so so what I'll be saying here really owes very much to that continuous discussion and collaboration that I have been very fortunate to be part of over the last few years so now if the future is in any way resemblant of what we have now then we can certainly assume that powerful efforts towards artificial general intelligence and also beyond that super intelligence will continue and with increasing impact giving keeping this General development in mind it seems necessary that we develop some rudimentary picture of what the ideal emergent intelligence would be like a sketch of our goal that is good enough to keep us on a productive meaningful and responsible track so this this paper is intended as a contribution to that type of effort against the backdrop of the AI alignment problem we will here consider a recently proposed simple model known as the stress care intelligence feedback loop or the sci Loop for short in order to understand forms of intelligence regardless of their sub substrates employing this framework will allow us to explore the implications of the buddhis subas commitment to knowledge of everything and knowledge knowledge of everything and for the benefit of all if care drives intelligence the buddh adva perspective is not just morally exemplary but it can also be considered as a model for radical cognitive expansion and so and yet how can a finite system possibly be directed toward infinite stress tolerance and Care in order to explore answers to that we will finally conclude by taking a classic recourse to shuna now when it comes to presentations of the alignment problem in AI then it can seem as if it presupposes that humans in general or Humanity as a whole have a relatively uniform and well-defined set of values and objectives it is as if we want to say that as long as we can make sure our AI systems are aware of and respect those so-called human values then Humanity stands only to benefit from the breath te breathtaking technological advances that are currently Transforming Our World but of course any brief look at our history and the world around us will of course put expectations to shame we humans are just as good at destroying each other as we are in providing help and support so in a world where the limits of what is humanly possible are now being radically Rewritten acknowledging this a simple and rather obvious State of Affairs seems to be quite crucial in order to survive and truly benefit from an ongoing technological revolution of which we have still barely seen a fraction we need to become decidedly better at caring for each other and our world better than we have been throughout our Evolution and human history so that is I think the challenge that AI brings but if we look at ourselves individually most of us will likely struggle to find a single coherent set of aims and values that we can claim really captures what we want and what motivates us even on a personal level our wants and desires can appear just as impossible to reconcile as they seem impossible to ignore how can we then even begin to look for a model of our of ethical intelligence that will make sense and be applicable to humanity as a whole recourse to our most deeply held philosophical political or religious convictions whatever they may be will hardly U be productive as long as it's still doubtful whether we can or whether we would even want to fully subscribe and adhere to them on an individual basis whatever our preferred ideology or belief system may be it's one thing to declare allegiance to a certain rule or principle but it's quite different matter to live according to the doctrine day in and day out but should not the rules and principles that we would want to be at the heart of an AGI or super intelligence not be ones that we ourselves can commit to in a deep and continuous fashion with all this in mind here we nonetheless suggest that the idea of a Buddhist Suba as defined in classic Buddhist thought an intelligent being committed to the attainment of omniscient Awakening for the benefit of all sensient beings provides a promising Way Forward on a cursory view it is perhaps hard to think of a better mind so to speak than one driven by an aim to understand everything that can possibly be understood both now and in the future but entirely for the sake of being able to provide for all beings in both temporary and ultimate terms we may differ dramatically in terms of what we believe is true fact and possibly knowable and even if our perceptions of facts and our beliefs about reality are in general agreement then we may very well still disagree about when and how knowledge should be shared nonetheless when push comes to shove Would we not generally agree that knowing things well is preferable preferable to the opposite at the same time knowledge brings power and so knowledge in the wrong hands can be disastrous knowledge in other words comes with responsibility along such L if we are looking for a sketch of Ideal intelligence the Buddhist was selfless pursuit of universal knowledge for the benefit of all presents itself as a candidate model we can also note that this quite traditional account of the Buddhist State of Mind does not hinge on a commitment to any particularly Buddhist ideas and it can instead in principle be understood independently of any specific historically or geographically definable able religious framework in fact and we will as we will argue below because the Buddhist adva model of mind and intelligent intelligence is driven by open-ended care it must necessarily operate without recourse to any context independent overarching Frameworks it has elsewhere been suggested as for example these papers that our Center has produced based on Michael Len the biologist's original work that the measure of a systems intelligence is best understood in terms of its capacity for caring if knowledge or perceptual power instead would equal intelligence then we should be calling a good encyclopedia or a powerful microscope intelligent and yet we do not instead intelligence expresses itself through and is driven by the care that arises in response to stress and then we see stress as the perception of a mismatch between what is and what should be the case along the lines of this model of stress care and intelligence or the sci Loop intelligence is the mere capacity for noticing and finding solutions to the stressful discrepan between current and preferred circumstances and Care defined as concern for for the allev alleviation of such stress is what drives the system in that process whenever an efficient remedy of a given factor of stress is then activated or employed the pure potentiality of intelligence spawns a concrete Problem Solver through the agency of care according to the sci model such problem solvers are activated intelligence the occasion of care acting on the potentiality of intelligence to engender a specific solution formulating the structure of intelligence systems along the lines of this St stress care and intelligence Loops Loop avoids any appeal to or postulation of individuals as permanent and indivisible that's desirable because analytic searches for individuals that feature the Simplicity of unchanging Oneness as is often either intuitively or philosophically associated with selfhood and thus also agency they all invariably come up empty-handed the s Theory of agency instead focuses on the Dynamics of agents that are defined by their relations their engagements and interactions as Evan Thompson also spoke to before in such intrinsically transformative agents we suggest that the three that three General Trends are noticeable if first of all in a given system care is capable of actively seeking stress challenges beyond what is given by the immediate context for example by be that or that is to say beyond the systems immediate perception of that mismatch between what is and what should be then that type of care Surplus Surplus if you want means that the activated intelligence that is displayed by that system is in a process of growth alternatively if the system's care is proportional with its current level of stress then the Press of the activated intelligence will remain at its current level and finally if the system shuns or seek to seeks to ignore its currently felt stress factors then that type of deficiency in care activates that systems AC indicates that the systems activated intelligence is Contracting now if we assume this perspective on of on intelligent systems how can we best account for the apparent efforts towards homeostasis that are nonetheless observed in living systems if in fact there are no truly unitary and enduring agents or selves then why do systems seems to operate as if they were an attempt at answering these questions will require careful and analysis of stress itself and so will take us to the beginnings of agency within the per perception of conflict between what is and what should be the case we suggest that the state of stress can be described as an activating construct stress is a construct in so far as it takes for granted the existence of a stable individual that is now either under threat or in need of augmentation although such an individ individual ultimately cannot be found yet stress is also an activating state in so far as it cannot be ignored and so it entails care indeed even the attempt at ignoring a given stress factor isn't in itself an aspect of care understood in this way an important upshot of this is that the equilibrium that is associated with the concept of homeostasis is an Ever emerging goal construct rather than an actual previous or subsequent State true equilibrium is unachievable unachievable because such a state would require Transcendence of context just as permanent and indivisible self foood Can Be Imagined or imputed but not in fact located within a world of causes and conditions the same is the case with genuine equilibrium therefore the equilibrium that is the Target in homeostatic drives becomes an a prompting Factor only by taking on an appearance of reality where in fact there's none we suggest that this constructive Dimension is at the heart of any expression of identity and should hence be born in mind throughout all efforts to model and generate intelligent agency if the sci L of intelligent systems is relevant then in other words such that care can be seen to be The Driver of intelligence then the buddhis ad's ideal acceptance of responsibility for relieving the stresses of all sensient beings then begins to stand out not only as an example of exceptional kindness but also as a model for radical cognitive expansion that is if intelligent systems expand proportionally with their care then the Buddhist Buddhist aders Universal and open-ended commitment to caring is then associated with a dramatic increase in intelligent progess and let us note that the association of universal care with universal intelligence is in fact at the heart of Buddhist accounts of the Buddhist ADV View and conduct where in fact which in fact describe loving kindness and intelligent insight as mutually reinforcing or two sides of the same coin therefore in the context of looking for models of Ideal forms of intelligence models that can help inform the development of of super intelligent AGI the buddhis model can then be considered because of two distinctive features the buddhis adva ideal is defined in terms of a universal kindness that considers both the temporary well-being and also the ultimate flourishing of every sentient being and be a revolutionary expansion of intelligence that Embraces all topics of learning and all that can be known pursuing the recognition of things both as they actually are and in the Myriad ways that they may appear to sensient beings now if a system knows the world so well that it can't be stressed in any way such a Noah would have to be omniscient and at one with the world so to speak such a system would have to be coextensive with the world to the extent that it could not be surprised by anything it's hard to conceive of something that could be that way let alone becoming that way free from stress through a process of achieving knowledge of infinitely many discrete facts so that finally there's knowledge of everything that is and will be the case now and in the in all future how could that be possible accordingly we have also described the process that leads from stress over care to intelligence as a loop that keeps feeding the given system new stress Perceptions in that way as long as there's cognitive processing there's no end to stress at the same time a budd's understanding of Ultimate Reality parata emptiness appears to have some the same qualities some of the same qualities that such a perfectly Flawless model of the world would have while in the case of a mature Buddhist advas such knowledge is described as unmediated and perceptual insight into emptiness can also be considered in the light of conceptual inferential representations therefore let us for the sake of the purposes of this preliminary document here decide that knowledge of emptiness means knowing that quote unquote everything is what it is in dependence on other things nothing is anything at all in and of itself as a short hand such an understanding Bears a semblance with the ever unstressed Noah of everything that we considered before because knowledge of emptiness is non-trivially applicable to everything throughout space time and whatever might be Beyond SP space and time for that matter and it's also in a significant sense stress free so if by knowledge of interess we mean the understanding that in this way everything is what it is in dependence on other things there's nothing that is or means anything at all by itself then we can further conclude that nothing can be the same as or different from anything else same must be the the denial of difference and different the denial of sameness but no two things can be exactly the same because if they were indeed identical we wouldn't be able to distinguish them in the first place we wouldn't be be able to say that these two are the same at the same time nor can two things be entirely different from each other because in that case we would not even be able to hold them up against each other for comparison in that way whether we think in terms of perceptions or inferences we have never had access to genuine examples of sameness or difference at a closer look things are then neither really different nor really the same but importantly this could not mean that things are a bit of both as if they could be somewhat similar but at the same time also quite different because if literal sameness and difference cannot be identified anywhere neither by perception nor inference what do those words actually mean what really are we talking about when we say that this is the same as that or those two are different things appear but the moment we apply just a bit of such analytic pressure it's as if they are no longer there such understanding applies equally to every single factor that might appear or exist and so the pro program of foundationalist philosophy turns out to be absurd because there is no ultimate ground to be found or imagined anywhere whatever might might be proposed as a grounding framework is a dependent construct itself and it constituent facts quote unquote a void of any independent reality any reality beyond their mere appearance as such obviously this also goes for the ideas profo proposed in the sentences just before this and so also emptiness is empty there is then a simple sense in which we can say that knowledge of emptiness is both accurate and all-encompassing both now and in terms of future events and whenever system might be aligned with that understanding there's then also a significant sense that it cannot be surprised because whatever may occur within or outside it has already been understood to be quote unquote devoid of inherent reality oraba whatever appears manifests the way it does doe to other things which in turn depend on still other appearances and so on at infinum if the system is told or tells itself you must have this or you must get rid of that all elements in the message are equally empty of independent reference and so ultimately neither more or less meaningful true or false than any other possible statement or message throughout time space and whatever might Li Beyond might lie Beyond in that sense the system can hardly be surprised by anything its model of the world has in a sense already taken everything into account whatever free energy there might be or seem to be is not really so and so so stress as such is mere appearance now such an understanding is nonetheless about the world just a second about the world and it is therefore not contentless if we try we will file fail to find to account for any of the contents of of such knowledge in any independent unassailable way because the very project of providing ultimate underpinnings is doomed from the start but we do not need to go searching for ultimate foundations and the groundless car of things can instead be recognized for what it is acknowledging an emptiness of all things can then mean recognizing a scale-free principle this is not remotely comparable to the act of concluding that there's nothing to see or know for the foral acknowledgement is by nature about that is it informs the given system about the character of the world in itself the world and its beings are maybe mere appearances and yet here we all are making endless round less differences in this way even a preliminary understanding of emptiness can in some sense take us Beyond stress something that is otherwise precluded along the lines of the seci loop the world may be just as dark or bright as otherwise but with knowledge of emptiness perceptions of mismatch between what is and what should be the case can now unfold unbounded because their parameters extend infinitely lending themselves to radical reinterpretation and reformulation we and all other intelligent systems cannot stop caring but our stress has no ground caring is spontaneous but the stress that fuels care has no more substance than the things we might see in an optical illusion neither real nor false in any unequivocal sense the stresses are then simultaneously the expression of infinite peace and infinite opportunity we suggest that this perspective too must be represented in any formalism that is developed with the bodh ADV ideal in mind and then if we suggest that the classic principle of the Buddhist ala May provide a much needed sense of direction in an otherwise seemingly headless race toward the many fleeting appearances of ever more powerful intelligence that's what we suggest then a Buddhist has we can note that a buddhis has an infinite tolerance of stress and in fact thrives on stress because a Buddhist ATA system is driven by care to perceive ever more things in their stress defined contexts seeing their stresses the bodh agent actively pursues remedies considering not only the immediate wishes and concerns of the recipients of their help but also their long-term Evolution and ultimate success with knowledge of emptiness there's no hesitation and fear and so no impediment for the unfolding of carrying intelligence across seeming barriers of time and space here we have considered the seci loop as an example of a model that applies equally to biology technology and hybrid forms of intelligence by analyzing the Dynamics captured in that simple model we have not we have noted features that makes the Buddhist stand out as an extraordinarily qualified and capable agent despite their rudimentary character we hope that these Reflections May contribute to an increasingly multidisciplinary and increasingly Global Endeavor enabling us to better understand the genuine bodh adva agency whether in conceptual mathematical or otherwise prac iCal terms thank you so much sorry for the going on
