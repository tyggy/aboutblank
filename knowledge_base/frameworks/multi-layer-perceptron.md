# Multi-Layer Perceptron

## Overview

A Multi-Layer Perceptron is a neural network architecture with hidden layers that enables computation of non-linearly separable functions through intermediate representations, allowing the network to learn complex, non-linear relationships in data. Beyond its technical role in machine learning, it serves as a conceptual model for understanding collective problem-solving systems that require interaction depth and layered processing, making it relevant to frameworks exploring how intelligence emerges through interconnected computational layers.
