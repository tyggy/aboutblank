  "synthesized_overview": "Multi-Scale Competency describes an organizational architecture where autonomous, goal-seeking agents operate at each hierarchical level, creating dynamic interplay between competition and cooperation across scales. This structure enables complex systems—whether biological organisms or artificial intelligence—to achieve robust problem-solving, adaptability, and evolutionary efficiency by distributing agency and decision-making throughout nested levels of organization. The framework explains how resilience and innovation emerge not from centralized control, but from the coordinated autonomy of multi-level agents that balance competing and cooperative interactions."
