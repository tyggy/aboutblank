  "synthesized_overview": "# Self-Model\n\nSelf-modeling is a fundamental organizational principle operating across biological and cognitive systems, wherein entities maintain coherent internal representations of themselves and their environments. At the cellular level, this manifests as commitment to developmental pathways that preserve tissue integrity, resist degeneration, and enable regeneration; at the cognitive level, it emerges as a higher-order process enabling agents to reflect on their own states and external worlds. This capacity for self-representation is double-edged—it serves as the foundation for both adaptive creativity and existential anxiety—and represents a critical bridge between biological self-organization and conscious intelligence."
