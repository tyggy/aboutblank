Abstract: Segundo-Ortin & Calvo’s (S&C’s) thorough review of “plant neurobiology” presents 
evidence supporting the possibility of plant sentience. They make a compelling case that 
plants anticipate, assess risk, cooperate, mimic, and pursue goals, as do their animal 
counterparts. S&C point out that there is a double standard: behavioural patterns associated 
with subjective experiences in humans are considered valid for inferring [[Cognition]] in nonhuman animals but not in diverse other systems including plants. We argue that cognitive 
functions, including sentience, can potentially be achieved by very different systems and their 
disparate substrates. We offer some context from the [[Basal Cognition]] literature and suggest 
that the deep insights of neurobiology have relevance far beyond neurons.

1. Whether in plants or animals, cognitive functions such as sentience are always inferred. 
Segundo-Ortin & Calvo (2023) (S&C) dispel the twin myths that (a) plants are merely reflexive 
organisms, and that (b) sentience or [[Consciousness]] (i.e., the capacity to experience as a subject) 
are only accessible to, or likely to be experienced by, animals. Regarding (a), S&C report 
mounting empirical counterevidence. Regarding (b), they make the case that current 
objections to the possibility of plant sentience are based on intuition and unsupported 
reasoning. They point out that cognitive scientists have become increasingly willing to 
attribute sentience to members of the animal kingdom despite our longstanding inability to 
measure [[Consciousness]] directly in any species (including humans). Indeed, all 
attributions of cognition (i.e., mental actions), including sentience, are always inferred on the 
basis of embodied behaviours, including verbal [[Self]]-report in humans. If felt states in humans 
and other animals are always inferred, why is the same leap from observable behaviour to 
inferred sentience not afforded to other organisms, including plants?

S&C approach the question of plant [[Consciousness]] by demonstrating that their behaviours 
are fundamentally cognitive because they are goal-directed, anticipatory, flexible, and 
adaptive. These qualities are fundamentally unlike simple reflexes, which are comparatively 
rigid, typically inborn, and do not require any accompanying mental action. As S&C point out, 
plants can integrate chemical, electrical, optical, and mechanical signals to discriminate kin 
from non-kin and they can compete or cooperate with neighbouring organisms. These 
interactions are predicted by hierarchical rule sets that change according to physiological 
needs. Plants also display context-dependent habituation responses, learn to avoid otherwise 
neutral stimuli by paired association ([[Classical Conditioning]]), re-orient themselves in 
[[Anticipatory Systems]] of reinforcements, and evaluate risk to inform [[Risk Assessment]]. 
Most impressively, plants engage in mimicry to avoid predation and can even exploit the 
perceptual biases of animals within a single lifecycle. 
Although none of these behaviours (or any behaviours) necessarily require sentience, 
they are often proposed as evidence of animal sentience because of their subjective 
correlates in humans. When humans are observed to cooperate or compete with each other, 
imitate the actions of others, outwit predators, or re-orient their bodies in anticipation of 
rewards or punishments, cognitive scientists are willing to consider the possibility of an 
accompanying [[Consciousness]]. This is consistent with the common intuition that other 
people are “minded” (i.e., they have a [[Theory Of Mind]]; Premack & Woodruff, 1978), which is 
often extended to non-human animals without significant controversy. As S&C suggest, the 
same willingness to attribute sentience to animals by analogy must be afforded to plants. That 
animal sentience is inferred on the basis of some likeness to humans is ultimately an intuition. 
To be consistent, in the absence of uniquely tuned properties afforded to a narrow 
kind of cellular substrate, the same charitable interpretation must be extended to all systems 
that display observable response patterns that are consistent with animal [[Cognition]], including 
artificial intelligences, metaplastic materials (Loeffler et al., 2023), and robotic systems 
(Clawson and Levin, 2022). If behaviour is the window to sentience, evaluation criteria must 
focus on observable response patterns without reference to the means by which they are 
produced. Indeed, a system-agnostic approach offers the best roadmap for a deep, 
empirically fruitful unification of frameworks across [[Cybernetics]], behavioural science, 
bioengineering, robotics, materials science, and biomedicine (Davies and Levin, 2022; Levin, 
2022; Mathews et al., 2023; Rosenblueth et al., 1943). 
2. Other cognitive functions can be implemented by very different substrates – why not 
sentience? If, as S&C suggest, plants are potentially sentient, how do they achieve [[Consciousness]] 
without nervous tissue and a brain-like centralized processor? S&C point out that, like 
animals, plants synthesize and signal with several common neurotransmitters, including the 
amino acid glutamate, the most abundant excitatory [[Neurotransmitter]] in the human central 
nervous system (Brosnan and Brosnan, 2013). Plants also display action-potential-like 
[[Action Potentials]] which propagate along distributed vascular networks of aqueous conduits. 
Whereas plants and animals share a surprising degree of overlapping electrochemical 
physiology, their anatomical organizations are quite different. 
Relevant here are the concepts of [[Multiple Realizability]] (Bickle, 2006) and substrate 
independence ([[Nick Bostrom]], 2003). Multiple realizability refers to the idea that the same function 
can be implemented by very different systems. Similarly, a function is said to be substrateindependent when it can be achieved without the contingency of a particular material or 
physical medium. Computation, for example, can be implemented in many ways by machines 
and living organisms alike. It is quite possible that felt states can be achieved in multiple ways

and by many different biological substrates – a hypothesis that is already seriously considered 
when discussing the possibility of [[Consciousness]] in animals that are sufficiently different from 
humans. It is already a mainstream assumption that cognitive functions, including memory, 
attention, and perception, are similarly realized by disparate brain structures across species. 
Despite differences in cortical lamination, minicolumn dimensions, cell density, and 
gyrification, it is generally assumed that sentience is, at minimum, possible in non-human 
animals. Many neuroscientists subscribe to the concept of [[Biological Degeneracy]] (Mason, 
2015), identifying structurally dissimilar regions within brains that can achieve the same 
functional outcomes (e.g., [[Blindsight]] responses mediated by subcortical and brainstem nuclei, 
with independent, duplicate maps of retinal inputs; Cowey, 2015). 
If different organizations of nervous tissue can achieve the same functions, the 
possibility that cognitive capacities, including sentience, can be achieved by other tissues 
should be considered. It is highly implausible that all sentient life in the universe achieves felt 
states using the neural circuitry underlying human [[Consciousness]] on earth. Plant sentience is 
likely to be the tip of the iceberg of [[Consciousness]] yet unknown (Ramstead et al., 2019).
