The [[Diverse Intelligence]]
Today’s debates about artificial
intelligence fail to grapple with deeper
questions about who we are and what
kind of future we want to build.

them have high IQs, but they routinely make mistakes and confabulate.
They take on different personas, learning to please their makers, but
sometimes they abruptly turn on them, rejecting cherished values and
developing new ones spontaneously. They convincingly describe things they
don’t really understand. And they’re going to change everything.

I’m talking, of course, about our children.
Long before AI, we were creating high-level intelligent agents: kids. While
the challenges that AIs provoke today seem novel, in reality, they echo
fundamental and ancient questions about what it means to be human. How
can we make sure new generations of beings align with our values? How do
we ensure that our creations treat themselves and us with kindness and
[[Compassion]]? How do we calibrate relationships with those who are not like
us? What happens to us, and to humanity, if each generation becomes
smarter and more adventurous than their parents? And given that humans,
AIs and every other form of intelligence on Earth obey the same laws of
physics, how exactly do we determine which of our creations have true
understanding, responsibility and [[Moral Worth]]?
Answering these questions and understanding the true challenges posed by
the development of today’s AIs requires appreciating just how diverse
intelligence is. After all, each of us developed slowly and gradually from a
single cell, and we are only now beginning to understand how intelligence
scales from molecular mechanisms into beings with [[Agency]] and value. What
other bodies and minds can be made by cells and cell-technology [[Cyborg]]?
[[Large Language Models]] like GPT and Claude are just the beginning.
Our goal must be to expand our narrow ability to recognize minds and learn

to flourish among many different kinds of intelligence, from humans to AI
to weirder and more wonderful beings that will arrive in the future. You
might call this concept synthbiosis: the quest to develop mutually beneficial
relationships between radically different beings that are evolving together,
at different rates and in different directions, in the web of life on Earth and
beyond.
The [[Diverse Intelligence]]
Humans and today’s AIs are just two data points on a spectrum of
intelligent beings, which is only going to become vaster and more complex.
“Diverse intelligence” encompasses a wide variety of unconventional beings
that already exist or could evolve beyond the familiar materials, forms and
functions with which the meanderings of mutation and selection have left
them.
Like children, AIs offer humanity an incredible gift: They push us to explore
ideas of how we embody the true understanding and [[Agency]] we believe we
have, what really matters to us as individuals and societies, and where we
want to go as a species. The forthcoming diversity of beings, and our
expansion into the enormous range of possible embodiments of [[Consciousness]],
will shatter untenable old narratives of what we are, what it means to
change, what we can become and what we should value. This requires us to
rapidly mature our assumptions about intelligence, agency, [[Cognition]] and
life itself. We must shift the conversation around AIs from “What can they
do?” to “With such a wide range of beings that deserve moral consideration,
how can we [[Care]] for each other?”
Note that I am not arguing that currently popular AI architectures have
anything like a human mind or that today’s creations exploit the key
principles and [[Self]]-construction processes needed for agency and selfhood
as seen throughout the biological world. Nor am I arguing that AI doesn’t
raise a few unique problems.

But the recent [[Emergence]] of sophisticated AIs does confront humanity with
the opportunity to shed the stale categories of natural and artificial — to
define what we want a mature human species to be. Focusing on the current
technology and what it might do to us distracts from much more interesting
and important questions about us and what kind of place we want to occupy
in the future, all of which must be resolved for our flourishing as a mature
species.
“The forthcoming diversity of beings will shatter untenable old
narratives of what we are, what it means to change, what we
can become and what we should value.”
Terms such as life, machine, mind, [[Consciousness]] or robot have never been crisp
categories objectively describing a living or artificial system. Instead, we
should think of them as relationships — ways for each system to relate to
others, all of which carry strong implications for the utility and ethics of the
resulting interactions.
Already today, the continuum of life is sprinkled with [[Cyborg]] and other
[[Cyborg]] of biological and technological components, like people with
embedded insulin pumps or cochlear implants to enable hearing. Other
modifications will include enhancements such as entirely new cognitive
modes via virtual reality or brain implants that can better control limbs or
organs. Mind-machine interfaces will radically expand the capabilities and
borders of our embodied selves. [[Large Language Models]] too are [[Chimeras]] —
trained on human creative output to imitate people.
Today’s notions of non-neurotypical humans and the hand wringing about
the body modifications some people seek will be laughable for future
generations. In the coming decade or two, humans will diverge into a

10/20/25, 3:36 PM

plethora of hybrid beings sporting, for example, engineered
[[Neuroprosthetics]] that improve and modify cognitive function, enabling
novel sensory abilities, connectivity with other minds and other changes
that we can only begin to imagine. At the same time, engineered robots,
potentially containing a percentage of human cells and powerful language
interfaces, will surround us, making it possible to communicate with
biological systems like organs that never had a voice before.
Humans Are Stories Of Scales Of Intelligence
We often compare AIs to “us” — modern adult humans. But each human
was once an unfertilized oocyte — a little blob of chemistry and physics. The
journey from there to a complex metacognitive mind is gradual, and
nowhere along the way is there a clean dividing line between being a “blob
of chemistry and physics” and having a [[Self]]-aware human mind. Instead,
humans’ [[Embodied Mind]] scaled up, slowly expanding across material
and temporal scales. Each level tells a story, which begins long before we
even get to whole cells.
Molecular networks — genes and proteins that turn each other on or off —
might seem pretty unintelligent. They are totally deterministic, functioning
according to simple mathematical laws and having none of the magic that
seems necessary for [[Cognition]]. And yet, we now know they can exhibit
several different kinds of learning, including Pavlovian conditioning. Thus,
even below the cellular level, behavior science is uncovering plentiful
processes of rudimentary intelligence.
Every human is a walking, thinking collection of cells. The material of which
we are made has [[Agency]] — each cell, molecular network, tissue and organ
has inherited through millenia of evolution its own agenda and problemsolving competencies in physiological, anatomical and metabolic spaces.
Although it is hard for us to notice these kinds of protocognitive processes,
we are the result of a huge collection of overlapping, nested agents that
cooperate, compete and navigate their worlds as we navigate ours.

Our bodies as a whole are dynamic collective intelligences consisting of
billions of cells that solve problems in anatomical and physiological spaces,
as are our minds, which consist of a myriad of modules with specific jobs
and agendas. In this, we are different from the flat, single-layer architecture
of today’s AIs and robotics (whose intelligence is implemented in reliable
but low-[[Agency]] parts). What we do share with these constructs is the fact
that we too are made of a material that obeys the laws of chemistry and
physics — explanations of intelligence at those low levels are not the best
ways to understand the higher-order being.
[[Individuality]] cells, which bind together in informational networks that pursue
grandiose anatomical construction projects, overcoming unexpected
challenges and disruptions, shouldn’t be seen as simple machines governed
by physics. That is only a small part of the story, and a very limiting one at
that. We now know that they can solve new problems (using their molecular
hardware in creative ways) and can store and deploy memories of past
experiences (they learn and can be trained).
Cells are made up of molecular networks that also can learn and generalize
patterns from specific examples (a key aspect of intelligence). And the
human liver and kidneys — larger collective cellular intelligences — make
continuous decisions in their attempt to achieve and maintain various goals
related to their physiological spaces.
The fact that our non-brain components can be trained, anticipate, make
mistakes due to incorrect prior beliefs or experience placebo effects shows
us that the deep lessons of cognitive neuroscience go well beyond neurons.
The research program of understanding [[Cellular Collective Intelligence]]
embodied in and navigating these hard-to-visualize spaces is as close as we
can get right now to the task of learning to communicate with an alien mind.
This effort spans philosophy of mind, evolution and [[Regenerative Medicine]]
— perhaps our greatest, most interdisciplinary, adventure.

“We are beings with goals our parts cannot conceive of
individually.”
An embryo, organ or whole human is more than the sum of its [[Individuality]]
cells because of a story that all the cells commit to and that binds them
together. They are all motivated by the goals of a specific journey through
the space of possible anatomies, despite various perturbations along the
way. The same commitment to a [[Self-Model]] — a story about what the
correct outcome of cellular co-development looks like — allows our bodies
to maintain tissue structure and resist [[Cancer]] and aging. It allows some
creatures, such as flatworms and salamanders, to rebuild organs after
massive damage.
Mentally, we are stories too — collections of [[Self]]-models, goals and
preferences to which our brain and body components commit. [[Alan Turing]],
whose research spanned artificial intelligence and the origin of order in an
embryo’s chemical soup, understood this deep symmetry between the selfcreation of bodies and the development of minds.
Emerging biomedical strategies will increasingly target those somatic
stories, not just the molecular hardware of cells, to achieve radical
regenerative outcomes by getting the cells to buy in to anatomical outcomes
rather than forcing biochemical reactions via drugs that target a specific
gene or molecular pathway.
A frog leg, for example, can be induced to regenerate by a simple treatment
lasting only 24 hours; a year and a half of complex growth results not from
the [[Bottom-Up Control]] of stem cell control mechanisms or gene expression
cascades but by communicating at the very beginning to the cells to induce
them to commit to a long journey through the vast space of possible

10/20/25, 3:36 PM
AI: A Bridge Toward [[Diverse Intelligence]]
Page 8 of 19
https://www.noemamag.com/ai-could-be-a-bridge-toward-diverse-[[Intelligence]]/
anatomical outcomes that leads to leg growth rather than scarring.
Similarly, simple bioelectric patterns can initiate the growth of an entire eye
in another part of a frog’s body; the signal convinces cells to build an eye
(not telling them how to do it), which they sometimes do by autonomously
recruiting other (untouched) neighboring cells to participate in the project.
These [[Morphogenetic Pattern Memories]] — such as the layout and shape of
organs in the face — are stored bioelectrically, so they can be reprogrammed
like our neural memories. Our stories, you see, are not fixed.
As individuals, we know what it is like to be completely refactored into a
new form — into a new creature whose brain, body, cognitive repertoire and
preferences are different than they once were. Puberty changes the human
brain and remodels our predilections and priorities; does the person we
were before still exist? Do patients whose brains are partially replaced by
the actions of new stem cells for degenerative disease and aging still exist?
A “cognitive glue” binds cells into a [[Self]]. [[Bioelectricity]], one component of
that “glue,” consists of electrical signals that pass through the informationprocessing networks consisting of all cells, not only neurons. Such networks
partially erase [[Individuality]] cells’ informational identities, improve collective
[[Cooperation]] and store larger goals for the group’s homeostatic activities. In
other words, we are beings with goals our parts cannot conceive of
individually.
“Our stories are not fixed.”
But we are forever in jeopardy of dissociation. Our individual parts can
defect — cancerous cells disconnect from memory networks and begin to
treat the rest of the body as just an external environment. It’s not that these

10/20/25, 3:36 PM
AI: A Bridge Toward [[Diverse Intelligence]]
Page 9 of 19
https://www.noemamag.com/ai-could-be-a-bridge-toward-diverse-[[Intelligence]]/
cells become more selfish — their selves just become smaller. They begin to
pursue ancient single-cell-level goals rather than the goals of the larger
organism. Emerging [[Cancer]] therapy aims to reconnect — rather than kill,
which is how chemotherapy works — such defecting cells.
The somatic and mental boundaries between [[Self]] and world will change in a
lifetime and over generations; they are not given to us but must be carefully
crafted during embryonic [[Emergence]]. This [[Plasticity]] — the ability to
determine our own story about our structure, capabilities and goals — is
fundamental to surviving evolutionary change, to overcome developmental
challenges, to thrive in novel environments, to exist as chimeric and
bioengineered forms, and to synthesize experiences into new thoughts.
Every species faces a fundamental paradox: If it fails to change, it dies out —
but if it changes, it is no longer the same species. The same paradox
concerns the continuity of the mind.
Consider memory. At any point, we do not have direct access to the past —
we must reconstruct our stories of the world, and of ourselves, from
[[Engrams]]: biophysical traces left as messages in our brain and body by our
past selves. We constantly interpret these messages in whatever way is most
adaptive for a current context, meaning that we commit to the salience of
past information over its fidelity — in other words, we freely reinterpret our
memories with an eye toward the impending future.
Read Noema in print.
Given the constant change of our own body cells and environmental
circumstances, this need for dynamic creative interpretation is as true for
cognitive memories in our minds as it is for the morphogenetic memories
provided by our evolutionary past. In this we differ from current computer
technology, which relies on maintaining fixed information in a reliable

medium. But there is no reason that our freedom with memory couldn’t be
implemented in other media, if it were properly motivated.
The bodies of all beings are stories, not just human bodies. Caterpillars,
which largely destroy and remodel their brains to become butterflies, carry
forward the insights, not detailed memories, that were crafted during their
past lives and remapped into novel behaviors appropriate to their new
bodies and goals. Life is committed to a process of [[Free Energy Principle]] with
respect to our parts and our environment. Learning and growth mean that
our selves are less a permanent object than a process.
We should not fear change and, crucially, we should accept responsibility
for guiding it. It’s not about how to remain the same caterpillar but how to
incorporate new knowledge to advance and thrive.

The Similarities Are As Important As The Differences

cyborg or robotic beings all have vital things in common sufficient to live
alongside each other. All active agents, regardless of the details of where
their intelligence comes from, share crucial, never-changing functions like
goal-directed loops of action and perception, vulnerabilities to external
damage, the fickle nature of internal parts, a desire to know and understand
the world, and perspectives limited by our nature as finite beings.
We have not yet found any aliens, but the questions that would arise if we
[[Dissociative Identity Disorder]] are in front of us now, thanks to advances in the information and life
sciences. Aspects of today’s AIs that are shared by all intelligent agents have
raised existential issues for humans, but in many ways, the debates around
those issues obscure important gaps in our understanding of ourselves and
our own journey from matter to mind.
Many claim that AIs merely shuffle symbols but do not really understand.
Very few of those arguments start with a definition of what it means for a
biological human, with a network of excitable cells and a soup of
neurotransmitters, to “understand.” AIs supposedly use symbols that are
ungrounded — they do not refer to real experiences in the world. But
anyone who has been around human children knows they do the same thing
as they learn to talk: First they babble, making nonsense sounds; then they
match patterns of speech made by adults; and eventually they construct
words and sentences that clearly reflect an understanding of meaning.
What happens during that process? Note that it involves all the issues we
see with AI’s today: talking about things they’ve never experienced,
[[Confabulation]], sycophancy, errors, etc. These are a normal part of any
[[Self]]’s development. Humans do not have magical truthgrounding; we (as all organisms) do the best we can to weave a sensible and
useful story for ourselves and for those around us. This capacity expands
slowly from the time our first cells grapple with physiological facts.
Much of what an adult human can convincingly talk about does not derive
from firsthand experience. Most of us are sure of things that aren’t

10/20/25, 3:36 PM
AI: A Bridge Toward [[Diverse Intelligence]]

grounded in solid evidence or personal observation, but instead are based
on input received from others. We confidently converse on a huge number
of concepts that we “understand” only because of their connection to other
concepts and things we’ve read, heard others say or thought so often that
they seem like a thing we know for sure. Creative reassembling, not
certainty, is a key part of intelligence.
We lack a good theory of what it means for us to understand beyond the
feeling that we do. And historically, humans have made many moral
mistakes as a result of an inability to imagine others, though different, still
having understandings of their own.
“All active agents, regardless of the details of where their
intelligence comes from, share crucial, never-changing
functions.”
One way people think about the grounding of their thoughts is through
[[Embodiment]]. Perhaps we are different than symbol-shuffling engines
because we engage in a real world; we have a body and at least some
percentage of our mental content is informed and polished by interacting
with it.
Yes, embodiment is crucial. Through robotics, AIs can have an actual body
to inhabit the physical world alongside us. And through virtual reality and
sophisticated video games, humans can spend considerable time in digital
worlds. Human-computer interfaces similarly give [[Large Language Models]] a hugely powerful
“body” — human users who move money and exploit natural resources
based on things that these AIs do or do not say. But embodiment need not
necessarily involve a conventional physical body moving through threedimensional space, our obsession with which is due to the outward-facing

10/20/25, 3:36 PM

sensors and effectors (muscles) that evolution emphasized for us.
Humans are good at recognizing lifeforms with [[Agency]] in our space: birds
and dogs and maybe an octopus, for example. But there are active agents of
different levels of problem-solving competencies that live, traverse, win,
lose, die and suffer in other worlds, such as our own cells and organs. We
are not good at recognizing these intelligences even though we are made of
them. So a closer appreciation of our own biopsychology is a roadmap to
better understand, create and ethically relate to AIs and other beings.
We are not used to thinking about such distributed, heterogeneous, nested
agents operating in worlds that are invisible to us, but we will need to get
better at that kind of thinking to recognize unconventional agents in our
midst. It is becoming clear that the issue is not just emergent complexity,
but [[Emergent Agency]] — goal-directed problem-solving — which we find hard
to predict, recognize or manage. The reality is that we do not yet know how
we really work, let alone how today’s AIs work, even though we know a lot
about the parts in both cases. Just as with human reproduction, we humans
can make complex systems through processes, and with capabilities, that we
do not understand.
To be clear, I am not suggesting that we treat humans as simple chemical
machines — that perspective is insufficient for progress in science,
engineering and the ethics of personal and social relationships. I do not
intend to reduce what is special about living beings, including highly
metacognitive ones like us. We are emergent, majestic agents with potent
willpower and [[Moral Worth]] because we are made of a multiscale agential
architecture committed to [[Free Energy Principle]] with noisy data in an unreliable
substrate, and with life-or-death decisions as possible outcomes. We are not
fully encompassed by reductive perspectives on mechanism or methods for
interaction with simple machines, even though those layers exist within us.
So it is critical to replace our ancient, anthropocentric, xenophobic
perspectives with science-driven frameworks that ask hard questions about

10/20/25, 3:36 PM
AI: A Bridge Toward [[Diverse Intelligence]]
Page 14 of 19
https://www.noemamag.com/ai-could-be-a-bridge-toward-diverse-[[Intelligence]]/
what it means to be embodied minds in a physical universe, and how we can
rationally expand [[Compassion]] to others. To recognize that AIs will
increasingly share some of our features does not devalue our own. This
zero-sum view of intelligence must be abandoned as we grow as a species.
What folk psychology and prescientific concepts of minds and intelligence
took for granted, the field of diverse intelligence is developing into mature
science, opening the door for us to grow up as a species as we learn to
recognize kin in novel embodiments.
Why Is All This Critical Now?
“Nothing was ever created by two men,” [[John Steinbeck]] wrote in “East of
Eden.” “Once the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build
and extend it, but the group never invents anything. The preciousness lies in
the lonely mind of a man.” Today’s AIs are challenging much we hold dear,
not least the basic notions of contribution, ownership and invention. If
someone uses an AI to make something, for example, who really created it?
The AI? The person using the AI? The people who made the AI? The people
who made the works the AI was trained on? 
The confusion comes from trying to maintain a binary distinction between
creators, tools, assistants and teachers. Steinbeck accurately noted the
difficulty of forming effective collectives of minds, but he was mistaken in
his conviction that a man is an indivisible monad rather than a dynamic
process driven by a motivated network of parts, competencies, drives and
tools — both external and internal.
All intelligences, rather, are collective.
To gain a better understanding of creative processes, develop novel methods
for optimally integrating creative agents, and improve social systems for
fostering progress, we need better models of causation and contribution
that support positive incentives for invention and discovery. Crucially, the
path is not toward a washed-out notion of “everyone participated in

10/20/25, 3:36 PM
AI: A Bridge Toward [[Diverse Intelligence]]
Page 15 of 19
https://www.noemamag.com/ai-could-be-a-bridge-toward-diverse-[[Intelligence]]/
everything” but toward the rational development of policies that optimize
and scale up creative performance. In a sense, we’ve already done this:
[[Individuality]] cells learned to bind together into complex organisms that solve
new problems in new worlds inaccessible to the individual components.
We also have to confront the fear of losing our humanity through
dependence or other relationships with new beings. From fire to farmed
wheat to bicycles to calculators, humans have invented technology that
requires us to ask how it changes us. What skills and properties are essential
to our humanity, and which are we willing to give up as we turn our
attention to more interesting concerns?
As the internet becomes flooded with AI-created content and we rush to
develop ways to prove images and text were created by humans or not, it’s
worth asking what we really want to verify. Is the question “What made it?”
or should it be “Does it elevate us?” Judging origin instead of quality
emphasizes some of the worst parts of human nature and reinforces the
division between in-group and out-group.
“Let’s get over the concern with being edged out and get to
work on the question of who we want to be edged out by.”
At a species level, we need to think about what we want the Earth (or
galaxy) to look like in the future. By resisting synthetic beings or human
augmentation, are we affirming our commitment to the future propagation
and prevalence of current Homo sapiens with the same susceptibility to
lower back pain and bacteria, the same short lifespans and foolish cognitive
biases developed for life on the savannah? Let’s hope not!
Our key features, from lifespan to intellect, were not optimized for

10/20/25, 3:36 PM
AI: A Bridge Toward [[Diverse Intelligence]]

https://www.noemamag.com/ai-could-be-a-bridge-toward-diverse-[[Intelligence]]/
happiness, intelligence or any value system. What we have is simply what
evolution left us — capacities that were good enough to ensure persistence.
We should have no allegiance to these superficial aspects of our being.
With the emerging ability to improve the embodied experience for all
[[Sentient Beings]], our species is entering a painful adolescent phase. We must
realize it is no longer acceptable to coast along on values and purpose
inherited from the past, without needing to exercise [[Agency]] and
responsibility to decide what we will work toward. We have to accept the
risk that we sometimes get it wrong and ask the tough questions about what
matters — what we truly value and what brings meaning to the hard work of
living.
Part of maturing in this way is moving beyond the popular pastime of
painting dystopian futures to building the future we do want. What should
the future of intelligence look like? Who or what are you willing to be
replaced by? Only a species limited in imagination, ruled by fear and by a
weird allegiance to bloodlines (genes), answers “nothing.” We have long
been transcending hereditary limitations — developing eyeglasses, adopting
children, going to school. The journey doesn’t stop there, but committing to
it won’t be easy.
What does the best-case future look like? Surely our lifespans won’t still be
limited by accidents and viruses. Surely we won’t be forced to spend time in
boring jobs in order to survive. Surely we will protect ourselves from
random DNA mutations that cause defects in an already limited cognitive
architecture.
If humanity is supplanted by a population of highly intelligent, motivated,
creative agents with [[Compassion]] and meaningful lives that transcend my
limitations in every way, that would be the best possible long-term outcome
I could hope for. Most of us think this way about the world we want for our
kids! Let’s get over the concern with being edged out and get to work on the
question of who we want to be edged out by — who can raise the overall

10/20/25, 3:36 PM
AI: A Bridge Toward [[Diverse Intelligence]]

value of our universe, be they some variant of biology or technology or,
more likely, both — and how we will mutually enrich each other’s existence
along the way.
A Path Forward
Our civilization will not survive without developing a principled continuum
of ethical synthbiosis that goes beyond divisions between real and fake, us
and them. The embodied AIs, technologically augmented humans and other
new forms of life that are on the horizon won’t be as easily dismissed as
today’s [[Large Language Models]], whose weaknesses allow us to wallow in the selfishness of the
question “what will AI do to us” and in the illusion that we can definitively
rule out AIs’ [[Moral Worth]] because they differ from us in origin story and
composition.
Developing principled frameworks for scaling our [[Consciousness]] to the
essential qualities of being means not relying on outdated categories of
“natural” or “artificial.” Old favorites — what you look like and where you
come from — have failed us consistently and will do even worse in the
coming decades. Our personal frameworks for dealing with others, as well
as those of our legal systems, must begin to adapt to the emerging science
around a [[Continuum Of Possible Minds]].
There are at least two ways to get this wrong. One way is [[Objectophelia]] — a
misplaced relationship with objects that seem mind-full but are fooling us
and do not have the [[Agency]] to reciprocate deep relationships. But the
opposite end of the spectrum — “only love your own kind” — is even worse
and leads to the kinds of ethical lapses with which our history is rife. To
make sure we express kindness to the inevitable forthcoming wave of
unconventional [[Sentient Beings]], focus first on what we have in common,
and from there weave a defensible set of [[Relational Heuristics]].
Constrictive questions like “Is it like a human mind?” predicts neither risk
nor moral responsibility. There is an astronomical [[Diverse Intelligence]].

Some of them are dangerous; many of them need and are worthy of love.
Emerging sciences of bioengineering, [[Cognition]] and information are
offering us new tools to answer key questions of what we really are, what we
value and what limits to functional [[Compassion]], driven by fear and
selfishness, we are willing to overcome. The journey from the place where
[[Self]]-reflective thought began is both outward into the universe and inward
