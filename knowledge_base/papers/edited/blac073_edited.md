The rich variety of biological forms and behaviours results from one evolutionary history on Earth, via frozen 
accidents and selection in specific environments. This ubiquitous baggage in natural, familiar model species obscures 
the [[Plasticity]] and swarm [[Intelligence]] of cellular collectives. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of the 
origin of anatomical novelty, of the relationship between genome and form, and of strategies for control of largescale structure and function in [[Regenerative Medicine]] and bioengineering. Analysis of living forms that have never 
existed before is necessary to reveal deep design principles of life as it can be. We briefly review existing examples of 
chimaeras, [[Cyborg]], [[Hybrots]] and other beings along the spectrum containing evolved and designed systems. To drive 
experimental progress in multicellular [[Synthetic Morphology]], we propose teleonomic ([[Teleonomy]], problem-solving) 
behaviour in diverse problem spaces as a powerful invariant across possible beings regardless of composition or origin. 
Cybernetic perspectives on chimaeric [[Morphogenesis]] erase artificial distinctions established by past limitations of 
technology and imagination. We suggest that a multi-scale [[Competency Architecture]] facilitates evolution of robust 
problem-solving, living machines. Creation and analysis of novel living forms will be an essential testbed for the 
emerging field of [[Diverse Intelligence]], with numerous implications across regenerative medicine, robotics and ethics.

INTRODUCTION: OPEN PROBLEMS AND 
KNOWLEDGE GAPS
Progress in molecular biology and genetics has led 
to great strides in understanding the micro-scale 
hardware of cells (the protein machinery encoded 
by the genome). However, as shown clearly by the 
trajectory of the information sciences, this is only the 
beginning; the next frontier is the software of life: 
developing a mature science of prediction and control 
over system-level phenotypes. Despite a deluge of 
big data on the molecular mechanisms necessary 
for specific functionalities, important capability and 
knowledge gaps remain with respect to the dynamics 
that are sufficient for the remarkable robustness and 
plasticity we observe in the living world.
A fertilized egg produces a cellular swarm that 
reliably [[Self]]-assembles into a highly complex organism. 
Importantly, this process is not hardwired: mammalian 
embryos cut in half produce normal monozygotic twins, 
because despite this damage each side can grow what 
is missing. Some organisms maintain this regenerative 
capacity throughout their lifetime; for example, 
salamanders regenerate limbs, jaws, eyes, tails and 
ovaries (McCusker & Gardiner, 2011). A salamander 
limb can be amputated at any level and will produce 
precisely the missing parts and then stop when a correct 
salamander limb is complete (when the distance from 
the correct [[Homeostatic Setpoint]] is sufficiently reduced). 
The ability to handle novelty in the form of external 
damage is not the only aspect of the robust plasticity of 
life; this ability also extends to unexpected changes in 
the internal building blocks of the organism.
Tadpoles generated to have no primary eyes, but 
an [[Ectopic Organ]] on their tail, can see reasonably well

(Blackiston & Levin, 2013); in their aberrant new 
location, eye primordia cells form a proper eye and 
often connect the optic nerve to the spinal cord. 
A brain that has evolved for millions of years to expect 
visual input to a specific location immediately adjusts 
its behavioural programmes to operate with signals 
coming from its tail. The same [[Plasticity]] has been 
observed in adult humans provided with novel senses 
and effector organs (such as prosthetics with novel 
degrees of freedom; Bach-y-Rita, 1967; Bach-y-Rita 
et al., 1969; Danilov & Tyler, 2005; Nagel et al., 2005; 
Shull & Damian, 2015).
Perhaps even more impressive are examples of 
structural robustness to change. Kidney tubules in 
newts normally form from the interactions of eight to 
ten cells in cross-section, working together to make a 
lumen of a specific size. Cell size can be made larger 
by artificially increasing the ploidy (chromosome 
number) of embryonic cells; that this results in a 
viable embryo is, in itself, amazing. Such animals 
are of a normal size and proportion, because fewer 
and fewer cells participate in the tubulogenesis as 
the cell size increases. Most remarkably, when cells 
are truly enormous, a single cell will wrap around 
itself to make a proper tubule (Fankhauser, 1945a, 
b). In this case, instead of the normal cell-to-cell 
communication, cytoskeletal bending is used to 
achieve the same [[Anatomical Target]]. Thus, diverse 
molecular mechanisms are triggered in service of 
a higher-level anatomical specification (a tubule of 
specific cross-section).
These changes in the quantity of genetic material 
and cell size are dealt with dynamically. Our robotics 
technology does not even begin to approach this kind 
of capacity, and any engineered swarm that could 
adjust to this type of novelty (perturbation in size 
and information content of its components) would be 
hailed as a milestone in artificial [[Intelligence]]. The 
connection to intelligence is not accidental: William 
James defined it as the ability to reach the same goal 
by different means (James, 1890). The proficiency of 
living systems in this respect is best revealed not by 
the reliable normal development of standard model 
species (which obscures the true capacities of cellular 
swarms), but by the type of engineered, novel beings 
of which the above altered examples are only the 
beginning.
This type of plasticity, in the context of epigenetic 
controls and responses to the environment, is 
familiar to biologists with respect to changes of the 
environment and epigenetic control (West-Eberhard, 
1998, 2005a, b) and extends to all scales, from the 
variability of the traditional environment of the 
whole animal to the microenvironment (internal 
properties) of organs and cells. Life is massively 
inter-operable, enabling functional chimaeras and 
[[Cyborg]] at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ 
and even organism levels (Nanos & Levin, 2022). 
What computations, algorithms or dynamics enable 
cellular collectives to respond adaptively, reaching 
the same form and function despite radical induced 
changes of circumstances? Importantly, all these 
phenomena show adaptations to novelty that exists 
on the time scale of an [[Individuality]], not requiring 
aeons of evolutionary search. This suggests that life 
exploits an architecture that provides much more 
efficiency than could be expected from a blind process 
that always chooses short-term gains (selection that 
adapts to a specific environment).
The answer to ‘what determines the shape of an 
organism?’ is often said to be ‘the genome’, but many 
deep questions remain about the relationship between 
the genome and anatomy. In addition to artificially 
produced [[Chimeras]], in which diverse 
genomes can live together and generate large-scale 
form and function (Nanos & Levin, 2022), some animals 
are natural chimaeras. Some species of planarians 
reproduce largely by fission and [[Regeneration]]; this 
avoids the segregation of the germline in a type of 
somatic inheritance: any mutation that does not 
kill a stem cell takes it into the next generation to 
proliferate in the lineage (Fields & Levin, 2018; Levin 
et al., 2019). For hundreds of millions of years, these 
animals have accumulated mutations and are even 
mixoploid; different cells within one animal can have 
different numbers of chromosomes. And despite this 
messy genome, they are champions of regeneration, 
building the correct body from even small fragments 
with very high anatomical fidelity (Saló et al., 2009); 
each piece of a cut planarian produces a perfect 
little worm. We have no models in developmental 
genetics that would predict that the highest fidelity 
of anatomical outcomes would be associated with 
genetic diversity that rivals any tumour. Indeed, 
planarian lines can even be made permanently two 
headed by manipulating the bioelectric circuit that 
stores head number (Oviedo et al., 2010; Durant 
et al., 2017), resulting in permanent ‘strains’ of 
animals whose cells continue to build worms with 
a different anatomical body plan from the genomic 
default. What is the relationship between the genome 
and anatomy, and what mechanisms allow biology 
to exhibit robustness and plasticity simultaneously, 
enabling adaptive, coherent organisms to arise in 
novel circumstances?
Moreover, the highly competent decision-making 
of cellular collectives in [[Anatomical Morphospace]] 
reveals a fascinating commonality between 
problems of [[Cognition]] (mind) and problems of body 
([[Morphogenesis]]). This fundamental link was well 
understood by early workers in developmental biology, 
such as [[Hans Spemann]] (Spemann, 1967), and those in

computer science, such as [[Alan Turing]] (Turing, 1952); 
it is only now beginning to be fleshed out (Grossberg, 
1978; Friston et al., 2015; [[Giovanni Pezzulo]] & Levin, 2015). 
Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, in that all of us 
have made the journey across the Cartesian cut (from 
the ‘mere physics’ of molecular networks in a quiescent 
oocyte to a thinking being) not only during evolution 
but also during our own lifetimes. What aspects of 
biological structure enabled mind gradually to develop 
and expand?
These knowledge gaps are not obscure issues in 
evolutionary biology and philosophy of mind. The 
whole of [[Regenerative Medicine]] hangs on the question 
of how to induce collectives of cells to build one 
structure rather than another. Birth defects, traumatic 
injury, [[Cancer]] and degenerative disease would all 
be solved if we had a mature science of making 
predictions and deriving rational interventions into 
the morphogenetic process (Levin, 2011). Advances in 
molecular medicine and genomic editing will not have 
an impact on biomedicine unless we know what to edit 
or which pathways to target to achieve system-level 
goals, such as ‘make a new arm’. It is no accident that 
current medical interventions that solve problems in 
the long term exist only in the realms of infectious 
disease and surgery. Transformative regenerative 
medicine awaits a mature understanding of how to 
induce collections of cells to make desired anatomical 
features.
THE NEED TO GO BEYOND STANDARD 
MODEL SPECIES
Chimaeras and bioengineered organisms challenge 
us to make predictions and spotlight areas in which 
genomics have driven unwarranted complacency. For 
example, when we make a frogolotl (a hybrid frog–
axolotl embryo), will it have legs, like a larval axolotl, 
or not, like a tadpole? If it has legs, will they be made of 
frog cells or only of axolotl cells? We have no models in 
biology to make predictions about such cases, despite 
having full access to the genomes of both species. 
Crucially, this inability to predict or control outcomes 
is not a special feature of rare ‘corner cases’; it lays bare 
the often-neglected fact that even for a single species, 
knowing its genome enables us to say almost nothing 
about the form or function of the organism it ‘encodes’ 
(except when we cheat by comparing the genome with 
that of organisms whose anatomy we know already). 
This is because, although the genetics specify the celllevel hardware of the system (proteins), the outcome 
is the product of physiological software dynamics that 
are not predicted easily from the hardware level (Lobo 
et al., 2014; Pezzulo & Levin, 2016).
If we ‘zoomed in’ to observe developmental events 
at the cellular level, seeing all of the stochastic cell 
behaviour and signalling noise, would we be able to 
predict that all of that activity would reliably give rise 
to a fish or mouse, if we [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]] not already know about 
development and the fact that it is highly reliable 
in a range of conditions? Managing the reliability 
of outcomes in novel circumstances challenges us to 
develop a science of predicting stable outcomes at 
large scales (for a similar issue in neuroscience, see 
[[Jonas]] & Kording, 2017). Knowing how to detect and 
characterize specific goal states (in the cybernetic 
sense) of collectives, such as cell groups, is a crucial 
part of understanding systems. Novel instantiations 
of multicellular life are a crucial dataset on which to 
train and improve the conceptual tools of scientists 
and learning machines and must complement the 
developmental biology of standard, evolved model 
systems.
Beyond life on Earth, how would we recognize 
novel forms of life? What is the appropriate 
scale of observation for detecting the behaviour 
and appropriate problem spaces in which life 
operates? Bioengineering provides a crucial inroad 
for exobiology; a stepping-stone for enabling 
generalization of biology such that we can detect 
truly alien forms of life if and when we encounter 
them. Regardless of natural life elsewhere, exploring 
the [[Problem Space]] of beings enables us to improve 
the terms and categories we use to understand life, 
manipulating all the components in a schema such as 
the traditional brain–body–environment framework 
to unfamiliar components, in order to see how our 
existing approaches break down when faced with 
unfamiliar implementations. Like the very successful 
strategy of looking for symmetries in physics, in 
biology we must ask which of our concepts are deep 
invariants. Which of them remain when contingent 
details of implementation (cell type, genetics, origin, 
etc.) are changed?
The need to expand beyond familiar life forms goes 
deeper than Feynman’s dictum, that we do not really 
understand a thing until we can make one ourselves. 
The future of biomedicine and engineering depends on 
being able to offload much of the complexity we wish to 
manage onto the system itself; for example, triggering 
a body to regenerate a limb in the right location 
instead of trying to micromanage its construction 
from the molecular level. This, in turn, relies on 
understanding the modules, decision-making and 
[[Cognition]] of which the system is capable. 
We have argued in the past that an important aspect 
of future medicine will involve guiding the largescale behaviour of cellular collectives with incentives, 
stimuli and set point rewriting (Pezzulo & Levin,

2015, 2016; Mathews & Levin, 2018), rather than 
micromanaging the structure of their parts. This means 
that we need to understand the algorithms guiding 
these systems at multiple scales and, in particular, 
their basal [[Intelligence]] (i.e. their ability to navigate 
physiological, transcriptional and morphological 
spaces competently despite novel circumstances and 
perturbations). However, such intelligence is rarely 
apparent in ‘normal’ circumstances, when a system 
appears to be doing the same thing every time; this is 
what gives rise to a view of most biological systems as 
clockwork mechanisms, full of complexity but without 
intelligence. In order to uncover, understand, control 
and, eventually, cooperate with the true intelligence of 
biology at all scales, it is essential to confront biological 
systems with novelty, both inside and out, and to study 
the context-specific problem-solving capacities and 
[[Plasticity]] (Braun, 2015) that are revealed in response 
to that novelty.
Chimaerism (mixing biological components) was 
a popular concept in the ancient world (Fig. 1A–C), 
but the story of Adam naming a discrete set of 
animals in the Garden of Eden (Fig. 1D) suggests 
a different and much more limiting picture: a type 
of essentialism that suggests sharp categories 
(distinctions of biological form) and natural 
kinds that do not, in fact, exist. We now have the 
opportunity to extend this story and ‘name the 
animals’ in a much deeper way, by understanding 
the design principles of biology that transcend 
extant evolutionary examples. The implications of 
embracing the space of possible beings will extend 
to terminology, conceptual frameworks, research 
programmes in several fields, and ethics.
Here, we initially review some examples of 
existing technologies that promise to expand our 
understanding of life radically. Going beyond 
classical chimaeras, we describe the mergers of 
diverse products of evolution and human design 
to sketch the dimensions of the space of possible 
beings. Given that origin, composition and familiar 
phylogenetic position will not be reliable guides 
to properties of living forms in this space, we then 
suggest an approach to the search for invariants: 
what do all such forms have in common that can 
be used to compare them directly and understand 
them? We suggest that goal-directed behaviour, 
in diverse spaces, is a central concept that fulfils 
the role of a framework for driving experimental 
approaches. Towards a unification of the sciences of 
the mind and body, we then introduce an expansion 
of neuro- and behavioural science outside the brain. 
We discuss the fields of [[Basal Cognition]] and diverse 
intelligence, in order to begin to generalize the 
idea of [[Teleonomy]] beyond the function of 
complex brains. We discuss [[Teleonomy]] as a guiding 
framework for understanding diverse aspects of 
biology, suggesting that a deep principle of biology 
is nested goal directedness at multiple levels. We 
next explore some implications of such a multi-scale 
[[Competency]] for evolution. Finally, we conclude with 
a sketch of a research programme, enabled by these 
ideas, which spans [[Regenerative Medicine]], robotics 
and ethics.

SYNTHETIC BEINGS: EXPANDING THROUGH

AND MINDS

Examples of novel ‘life as it could be’ (Fig. 2) are 
highly diverse, and current technologies and proof-ofconcept results clearly indicate the coming diversity 
of life in the near future (Doursat et  al., 2013; 
Doursat & Sanchez, 2014; Kamm & Bashir, 2014; 
Ebrahimkhani & Levin, 2021). These novel life forms 
result from the recombination of existing evolved 
components at multiple scales (DNA, cells, tissues and 
organs) (Nanos & Levin, 2022) and the incorporation 
of designed components, such as nanomaterials, 
electronic/chemical/optical interfaces and software 
algorithms; replacements can be made at every level 
of organization, with parts that occupy some position 
with respect to functional sophistication and origin 
(Fig. 3). Table 1 is an overview of some key examples 
(although sharp boundaries between these categories 
cannot be drawn), and we describe only a few in detail 
(Fig. 4).
Bioengineering and evolution work in the same 
living medium (Wagner & [[Robert Rosen]], 2014; Ollé-Vila et al., 
2016); thus, we first consider an example of an entirely 
natural evolved functional chimaerism, where two 
kingdoms of life come together to form a new hybrid 
system (Fig. 4A–D). Ophiocordyceps unilateralis 
s.l. is a fungal parasite that creates ‘zombie ants’ of 
Camponotus castaneus, a carpenter ant (Andersen 
et al., 2009). This fungus infects an ant, freely flowing 
through the circulatory system of the host. After it 
expands throughout the organism, takes over the 
body of the host ant. Under control of the fungus, 
the host ant navigates to a plant located near the 
semi-permanent food trails of the colony, climbs up 
to an optimal growth zone and bites onto the plant, 
allowing the fungal spores to disperse onto uninfected 
ants wandering the nearby trails. Most interestingly, 
the brain of the host ant is left entirely untouched 
(Fredericksen et al., 2017). This poses the question of 
how a ‘simple’ fungus can manipulate the behaviour of 
the host ant in such a reproducible way. To achieve its 
goal of reproduction, the fungus must adapt to sensory 
signals from the environment; this involves processing 
the incoming signals to determine when it has come 
in contact with a suitable host and can thus begin 
targeted growth by navigating inside the host body. 
Importantly, this process needs to be precise enough 
to take control of the host ant without altering the 
behaviour of the host too strongly, because ant colonies 
will reject infected members of the colony. However, as 
the fungus infects the host ant further, what incoming 
signals does the fungus receive and how does it process 
these signals now that it is in a body not its own? Is it 
cut off from the external world and does it ‘see’ only the 
inside of the ant, or does the fungus hijack the sensory 
system of the host, thus acquiring new ways to sense 
and act in the world? Although these are unanswered 
questions, the study by Fredericksen et al. (2017) 
demonstrates that large, complex fungal networks 
invade the muscle fibres in the host, potentially 
allowing for precise body-wide control without need 
for the brain-to-central nervous system axis. However, 
[[Self]]-based modelling shows that the fungus might 
hijack and repurpose the ‘food searching’ behavioural 
regimen of the ant into an algorithm to find sites for 
fungal dispersion (Imirzian & Hughes, 2021). This 
would imply that O. unilateralis s.l. has developed 
a way evolutionarily to exhibit control of a dynamic 
system (the nervous system of the host ant) without 
needing to understand how the nervous system of 
its host functions. It is clear that there is much to be 
understood in chimaeric ‘life as it is’ studies, because 
researchers can study existing evolutionary accidents 
to reveal common relationships between brain, body 
and behaviour across species and systems.
The field of artificial chimaeras has been realized 
most notably in brain–computer interfaces (Bonifazi 
et al., 2013; Buccelli et al., 2019; Degenhart et al., 
2020). Willett et al. (2021) carried out a remarkable 
study that merges existing biological systems, here the 
motor cortex in a human subject, with technology to 
provide a way for a patient to communicate with the 
outside world even years after the onset of paralysis 
(Fig. 4E–G). They instructed a patient to ‘to “attempt” 
to write as if his hand were not paralyzed, while 
imagining that he was holding a pen on a piece of 
ruled paper’, while recording neural activity from the 
precentral gyrus. Using a variety of methods, neural 
activity was decoded and associated with each letter, 
allowing a computer program to produce written 
sentences for the patient in real time at a speed much 
higher than other approaches (Willett et al., 2021). 
In many ways, this artificial chimaera works in the 
same way as the parasitic fungus; experimenters do 
not need to know how certain neural dynamics arise 
owing to imaginary handwriting, merely that these 
signals can be used to drive goal-directed behaviour. 
In addition, this particular patient was not paralysed 
at birth; writing had been learned before the paralysis, 
and the hypothesis is that this aided in the stability 
of the decoded neural dynamics. This is similar to the 
case of the zombie ants; the fungi were not necessarily

creating a new behaviour in their hosts but were 
instead exploiting existing behaviours towards a goal. 
In the case of Willett et al. (2021), the chimaerism 
arises artificially; the computer software is built 
to sense the ‘environment’ of motor cortex neural 
dynamics to produce action in a virtual world, action 
that previously was not possible. It is important to note 
that the neural signals were recorded from a cortical 
region of the brain associated with motor movement. 
Indeed, it is assumed that specific cortices evolved 
to control specific behaviour, and although neural 
representations of movement can change owing to 
prosthetics (Kieliba et al., 2021), the question is raised: 
can neurons from other modalities, such as vision, be 
trained in external motor control? How ‘frozen’ is the 
behaviour of cortical regions?
[[Hybrots]] and animats are systems composed of neural 
cultures, coupled via closed loop techniques to physical 
robots (in the former) and virtual animals (in the latter), 
and are ideal platforms for tackling such questions 
(Fig. 4H, I). Early examples were developed in 2001, 
when DeMarse and co-workers dissociated cortical 
tissue from rats and cultured it as a two-dimensional 
plane of neural tissue on a microelectrode array; this 
array was capable of recording the electrical activity of 
the tissue while delivering stimuli via electrical pulses 
(DeMarse et al., 2001). The spiking activity of the 
neurons drove a virtual animal, the animat, in a virtual 
maze by associating unique spatiotemporal spiking 
patterns with directional movement. Feedback based 
on that directional movement and on the distance to 
obstacles in the maze was then returned to the culture. 
This was designed to mimic how neural systems have 
evolved to take input and interact meaningfully with 
the world, with the goal of allowing the culture to learn 
relationships between its own activity and incoming 
‘sensory stimuli’.
This paradigm was later used to build MEART 
(multi-electrode array art), a hybrot that was built 
to create art through neural control of robotic arms 
attached to drawing utensils (Bakkum et al., 2007b). 
This study focused on examining the stimulus 
(patterned training stimulus) that was applied to the 
neural culture, based on the present drawing and the 
desired ‘goal drawing’, a black square in the middle of 
the canvas. Here, they reported that although there 
were shifts in synaptic [[Plasticity]] in the network, if 
the patterned training stimulus was not updated at 
regular intervals, the overall behaviour [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]] not reflect 
any signs of learning. This closed-loop chimaeric 
approach allows for investigation of the plasticity 
with which evolved biological components learn to 
function with novel bodies and environments. It is 
not known how neural systems adapt their dynamics 
as new behaviours, whether goal directed or not, are 
learned, with hypotheses typically revolving around

changes in synaptic weight. However, there are many 
ways in which underlying neuronal circuitry might 
change. [[Hybrots]] are poised to serve as a generalpurpose platform for understanding the basic rules of 
engagement for neural systems, because they lack the 
evolutionary complexity of complete nervous systems 
that might confound interpretation, yet they still 
possess goal-directed capabilities.
The many diverse viable combinations of evolved 
and engineered components reveal a rich medium in 
which to understand truly general principles of selforganization of structure and function in unexpected 
circumstances. The ability to make novel living beings 
(Nanos & Levin, 2022) is significant in several ways. It 
frees us from the contingencies and frozen accidents 
of the trajectory of evolution on Earth and shows us 
life as it can be, enabling us to expand our thinking 
and generalize to learn lessons of biology in its general 
form. It allows us to probe the [[Intelligence]] of life at 
all levels by exploring the degree of goal-directed 
behaviour, [[Competency]] and failure modes of living 
modules in highly diverse environments. However, 
novelty is not only about new external circumstances. 
Some of the most informative aspects of perturbation 
are changes of inner composition; changes to the 
parts of the living system itself that are enabled by 
chimaerism and bioengineering. The introduction 
of synthetic DNA constructs, nanomaterials and 
other components into living systems reveals how 
multicellular collectives handle rapid changes in the 
properties of their parts. Response to a wide variety of 
new challenges is the cornerstone of the study of the 
intelligence of any system, including that of evolution 
(generalizing adaptive behaviour beyond previously 
encountered challenges).
A hallmark of chimaeric and bioengineered 
organisms is that they are functional; they operate in 
physiological and behavioural spaces and often exhibit 
the same robustness as evolved beings with respect 
to being able to reach specific states or behaviours 
despite perturbations. Figure 5 shows an example 
in which the traditional brain–body–environment 
schema is maintained while setting all of its [[Individuality]] 
components to be as unusual as possible. The study of 
this class of systems provides ways to uncover novel 
goal-directed activities that are masked by default 
developmental constraints and standard ecological 
scenarios. But most of all, the diversity of composition 
and provenance in this rich space of possible life forms 
requires us to look for a deep invariant: a parameter 
that can help us to recognize, compare and relate to 
intelligences in novel embodiments, when the familiar 
phylogenetic tree offers no convenient classification.
[[Basal Cognition]] AND DIVERSE 
INTELLIGENCES: [[Teleonomy]] AS 
A COMMON THREAD
Intelligence is the ability to reach the same goal 
through different means.
[[William James]]
One important promise of synthetic life forms concerns 
what they can tell us about the relationship of mind and 
body (i.e. [[Cognition]] in novel media). Importantly, the 
ability to solve problems in various spaces, with diverse 
degrees of competency, is known to extend well beyond 
brains. The emerging field of basal cognition seeks to 
understand the roots of intelligence in ancient, preneural forms and unfamiliar guises (Jennings, 1906; 
[[Paul Lyon]], 2006; Balazsi et al., 2011; [[Fred Keijzer]] et al., 2013; 
Lyon, 2015; Baluška & Levin, 2016; Baluška et al., 
2021). Recently, it has been argued that the origins of 
problem-solving in novel circumstances (behavioural 
intelligence) lie in ancient capacities that long predate central nervous system development (Fields 
et al., 2020). The implications of this view include the 
idea that the tools of neuroscience can be applied far 
beyond neurons, to understand how all types of cells 
join into collectives that work to achieve large-scale 
objectives (Levin, 2019, 2022). Importantly however, 
we must look beyond behaviour in three-dimensional 
space (movement) as the arena in which intelligence 
can be observed. Life solves problems in many 
different spaces, and [[Chimeras]] help us to 
widen our criteria and begin to recognize intelligence 
in unexpected guises. The ability to rearrange neural 
structures in novel configurations also reminds us that 
as collections of neurons, beings with brains are, in an 
important sense, also collective intelligences.
[[Morphogenesis]] by cell groups is a natural example 
that is only now beginning to be understood as a 
[[Collective Intelligence]] problem and to be investigated 
using the same tools and conceptual paradigms as 
those used in neuroscience (Fig. 6). For example, 
by a two-dimensional neural culture in an MEA, and behaviour exists solely in a virtual world. For MEART, a two-dimensional 
culture controls the arms of MEART by controlling air compressors for hydraulic motion. Adapted from DeMarse et al.

tadpoles with craniofacial organs placed in abnormal 
positions can become frogs with normal faces, 
because the components of the head will move around 
as needed to produce a correct face (Vandenberg 
et al., 2012; Pinet et al., 2019). This ability to find 
the right region of [[Morphospace]] corresponding to 
a normal frog anatomy, despite components of that 
anatomy starting off in the wrong position, reveals an 
important fact visible in many examples of regulative 
development, [[Regeneration]] and remodelling (such 
as those described in the Introduction). Evolution 
does not simply make hardwired machines that 
execute a predetermined set of steps (such as the 
default movements of tadpole eyes and jaws during 
[[Metamorphosis]]). Instead, it produces hardware that 
can execute [[Homeostatic Loops]], traversing novel 
paths in morphological and transcriptional spaces 
(Elgart et al., 2015; Schreier et al., 2017; EmmonsBell et al., 2019) to achieve their target morphologies. 
Models of [[Morphogenesis]] as [[Collective Intelligence]] 
are driving empirical work to understand what such 
systems measure, how they store set points for their 
homeostatic activity, how these set points arise and 
how they can be edited by biomedical approaches 
(Mathews & Levin, 2018). They also suggest a 
research programme to understand how homeostatic 
loops scale and pivot across problem spaces during 
evolution (Levin, 2019, 2022).
A focus on the actions of systems in arbitrary spaces, 
rather than on their anatomical or molecular–genetic 
composition, requires us to identify invariants that 
can serve as a parameter by which to organize and 
compare highly diverse types of agents in unfamiliar 
embodiments. We suggest that one important and 
interesting thing that all agents, no matter their 
composition or origin, have in common is goal-directed 
behaviour (at some level of [[Competency]]) (Rosenblueth 
et al., 1943).
Goal-directed behaviour is, at the very least, 
uncontroversial in human animals. It is thought that 
this capacity is enabled by collectives of neurons 
(brains) exhibiting memory, error minimization 
capacity and second-order metacognition that 
enables us to think about those goals (and perhaps 
re-set them) in addition to executing them. However, 
brains evolved from much more ancient bioelectric 
networks that are formed by all cells in the body and 
are as old as bacterial biofilms (Prindle et al., 2015; 
Fields et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). These networks 
readily form circuits with memory that enables basal 
homeostatic function (Pietak & Levin, 2017; Cervera 
et al., 2018, 2019, 2020). The remarkable capacity to 
exhibit both robustness and novelty in morphogenesis 
reveals the central role of the scaling of goals as an 
explanatory, facilitating concept for new basic research 
and biomedical applications (Levin, 2019). What is 
essential is to understand and [[Tame]] the gradual 
changes in [[Cognition]] that occur in the 
slow transition from egg cell to complex goal-driven 
cognitive [[Self]] with intrinsic purposiveness.
Cybernetic approaches are substrate independent 
and remind us that no specific materials (cytoplasm, 
neurons, etc.) are required for the key capacity of protocognitive systems (and perhaps all life): homeostatic 
and [[Homeostatic Loops]] that expend energy to attain 
specific preferred states with respect to information, 
prediction error, metabolic conditions and anatomical 
configurations (Allen & Friston, 2018; Constant et al., 
2018; Badcock et al., 2019; Ramstead et al., 2019). 
This view emphasizes a central invariant that unifies 
all attempts to predict, control, recognize, create and 
relate to such systems: [[Teleonomy]] (i.e. goal-directed 
behaviour that achieves specific observable states, by 
different means and with varying degrees of reliability 
and competency; Rosenblueth et al., 1943; Bertalanffy, 
1951; Varela & Maturana, 1972; Varela et al., 1974, 
to feed the brain. The collective needs to work together to [[David Power]] themselves and the central controller. C, importantly, the 
environment is not only the arena, but also includes other sentient agents. The arena is watched over by an audience of 
human observers, who express their degree of approval of the antics of the robots (or explicitly pay for additional glucose) 
via real-time social media posts on their networked hand-held devices. An artificial [[Intelligence]] (AI) language processor 
scrapes the social media posts, converts the text into specific tokens and feeds it to the brain as input to its sensory neurons. 
Much like our cells, the robots also have a degree of their own on-board AI, and the behaviour of the whole system is a very 
complex interplay of input, learning, noise, unreliability of components (including those of the observers), etc. This thought 
experiment is designed to shock us out of our typical assumptions about what a functional brain, body and environment 
must look like, in order to illustrate the immense variety of different implementations of the central components of an 
environmentally embedded cognitive agent. All the [[Individuality]] pieces of this construct are possible with current science 
(Ebrahimkhani & Levin, 2021; Nanos & Levin, 2022; Pio-Lopez, 2021). How can we understand, predict, communicate with 
and relate to such alien creatures? New bioengineering technologies are leading to an inevitable one-way journey out of a 
biology limited to a discrete set of forms that happened to have evolved on one planet. When origin story and composition 
cease to be good guides to how one should relate to a system, teleonomic capacity is one central concept that will survive the 
coming decades and drive advances in next-generation research and ethics. B taken with permission from Ebrahimkhani &

1991; Maturana & Varela, 1980; Lander, 2004; 
McShea, 2016; Turner, 2017). This independence from 
implementation details, and a willingness to recognize 
navigation towards preferred states in any problem 
space, removes traditional but limiting opacities from 
the lens through which we view ‘agents’ that exhibit 
teleonomic behaviour; such [[Self]]-imposed filters, like 
a type of mind-blindness, have restricted research, 
because our perceptual systems are tuned to recognize 
only familiar types of [[Agency]] (i.e. that of medium-sized 
beings navigating three-dimensional space).
[[Teleonomy]] here is proposed as a conceptual tool 
to drive the creation and analysis of novel synthetic 
beings. Rather than (as is sometimes claimed) being a 
tool to distinguish living beings from ‘mere machines’, 
it provides a unifying framework to understand the 
whole multidimensional spectrum of possible agents. 
[[Cybernetics]] (Rosenblueth et al., 1943) is an ideal 
framework for life as it can be. The dissolution of 
shallow, contingent boundaries between evolved and 
engineered systems was foreseen long ago in the title 
of Wiener’s foundational work, ‘Cybernetics, or control 
and communication in the animal and the machine’ 
(Wiener, 1961). It gives us a mature framework for 
understanding goal-directed behaviour without resort 
to mysterianism; dynamical systems and control 
theories offer rigorous formalisms for understanding 
causes of long-term behaviour as types of navigation 
policies in [[Problem Space]] (Pfeifer et al., 2007). Attractors 
(regions of the state space not occupied by the system 
at a given moment) serve as empirically useful views 
of causes of system-level behaviour as it navigates the 
space, guided by its non-local topology (Manicka & 
Levin, 2019). In keeping with the practical engineering 
focus of our approach, we eschew questions of [[Teleonomy]] 
(philosophical wrangling over real, objective purpose 
or agency) and focus on [[Teleonomy]] and problemsolving behaviour that is apparent, or relative, to an 
observer (usually, scientists, but also to the system 
itself, in the case of sufficiently sophisticated agents). 
This approach has already been emphasized by key 
early figures in cybernetics: ‘organization is partly in 
the eye of the beholder’ (Ashby, 1952). Thus, our ability 
to detect, understand and manage teleonomy says as 
much about our own [[Intelligence]] as it does about the 
system being studied (Sims & [[Giovanni Pezzulo]], 2021).
We propose a specific hypothesis about the 
fundamental origin of the [[Plasticity]], robustness and 
intelligence in diverse embodiments: that life exploits 
a multi-scale [[Competency Architecture]] that allows the 
products of evolution to thrive in the face of novelty. It 
is obvious that biological systems are hierarchical in 
terms of structure. More recently, studies of molecular 
genetics and developmental biology have revealed the 
modular nature of functions in the body. What is only 
now beginning to be appreciated is that the subsystems 
making up living bodies exhibit multi-scale goal 
directedness: each subunit has an agenda (a goal of 
some scale) in its various spaces. Classical workers 
in developmental biology recognized this ‘struggle of 
the parts’ (Heams, 2012) and their ability to reach 
goals ([[Coarse-Graining]] of molecular microstates into 
meaningful anatomical set points) by different means. 
The ability of parts to cooperate and compete (Gawne 
et al., 2020) within and across levels of scale and 
organization has fascinating implications. We next 
consider the implications of [[Multi-Scale Competency]] 
for natural evolution and for synthetic bioengineering 
and robotics.
MULTI-SCALE [[Competency]] POTENTIATES 
EVOLUTION
Expanding our capacity for bioengineering novel 
life forms towards complex outcomes requires 
learning to work with agential materials; that is, not 
micromanaging outcomes at every level, but guiding 
self-assembly by inducing components with agendas 
and competencies to change their default behaviours 
(guided self-assembly). Evolution learned to work 
in this medium first (Vane-Wright, 2014; Watson 
& [[Eörs Szathmáry]], 2016), and we can benefit greatly 
from understanding how it manages (and benefits 
out by a process of [[Neural Decoding]]. B, evolution discovered the importance of electrical networks for [[Cognition]] 
and binding into collective selves long before brains appeared. An ancient function for [[Developmental Bioelectricity]] existed in all 
somatic cells, which work in a manner isomorphic to that of familiar neuroscience content. All cells have [[Ion Channels]] and 
[[Gap Junctions]], resulting in bioelectric dynamics that also solve problems; they control cell behaviours (such as differentiation 
and migration) in [[Anatomical Morphospace]]. Like the brain, they are subject to reprogramming by stimuli or experiences 
and they carry out numerous goal-directed activities that serve the collective. Current research has ported many of the 
same tools as those used for neural decoding to understand the morphogenetic code implemented in the somatic bioelectric 
medium. Functional tools cannot tell the difference between neurons and non-neural cells, because they are fundamentally 
similar in their ability to execute [[Homeostatic Loops]] and scale up to larger agents via bioelectrical coupling. Images in panels

from) a multi-scale architecture. All the engineering 
accomplishments listed in Table 1 benefitted from 
the fact that scientists [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]] not have to micromanage 
(create from scratch) every part and its activity; 
instead, they recombined biological systems at chosen 
levels and depended on reliable components to exert 
their competencies in new circumstances.
The standard picture of evolution is that of an 
undirected search of [[Morphospace]]. The problem with 
the much more efficient ‘Lamarckian’ algorithm is not 
the contingent and porous Weismann barrier between 
germline and soma (Jablonka et al., 1998; Anava 
et al., 2014); instead, it is the much deeper issue of 
the [[Inverse Problem]] (Lobo et al., 2014): because the 
relationship between genome and anatomy is highly 
indirect, it is, in general, very hard to compute which 
changes in DNA should be made to canalize any desired 
bodily change (such as a neck stretching after taller 
branches). The same [[Credit Assignment Problem]] is at 
the heart of efforts in machine learning: how to modify 
the subunits (and which ones) to reduce error, given 
feedback from the environment? Both these issues 
are strongly impacted by a [[Multi-Scale Competency]] 
architecture. One instructive example is the fact that 
when eye primordia are grafted onto tadpole tails and 
the primary eyes are removed, the resulting animals 
can still see (perform visual learning tasks and 
behaviours). The primordial cells still make a proper 
eye even in a novel environment (in the midst of muscle 
tissue); the eyes put out an optic nerve that connects 
to the spinal cord (a novel target instead of the brain), 
and the brain properly interprets data arriving by this 
novel route and folds it into the behavioural repertoire 
of the animals (Blackiston & Levin, 2013). Likewise, 
experimental introduction of additional bones in 
vertebrate limbs results in adjustments of ligaments, 
muscles, motor neurons, etc. to enable a functional limb 
that balances mechanical load correctly (Hallgrímsson 
& Hall, 2011; Sultan et al., 2022).
These examples readily illustrate the implications 
for evolution, because macro-scale changes are readily 
accommodated: it is much easier to explore a fitness 
landscape when the goal-directed [[Competency]] of the 
parts can be relied upon not to wreck the adaptive 
character of the body when things change. When the 
parts themselves are goal-directed agents, evolution is 
greatly accelerated. Indeed, [[Teleonomy]] is at the core 
of reliability (which enables a searchable, continuous 
fitness space). Complex systems can persist and be 
improved and built upon continuously because the goal 
directedness of their parts enables other parts (and the 
collective) to trust that they will accomplish their task 
(making it practical to invest energy in activity and 
architectures that rely upon them working properly). 
This begins to blur distinctions, and emphasizes 
commonalities, between the processes implemented by 
evolution and rational engineers (Kauffman, 1971).
Owing to these dynamics, multi-scale competency 
increases the apparent [[Intelligence]] quotient (IQ) of the 
evolutionary process (Watson et al., 2014, 2016; Watson 
& [[Eörs Szathmáry]], 2016; Szilagyi et al., 2020; Czégel et al., 
2022). It is no longer as short-sighted in fitness space 
(although it is undirected in genotype space), because 
the competency of the parts enables the specific moves 
it makes to be much better than they otherwise would 
be. Teleonomic robustness in various spaces enables 
competency in fitness space without directed mutation 
(which the inverse problem makes extremely difficult, 
in any case). This not only accelerates the search, 
but also changes the very nature of what is evolved. 
Evolution does not produce specific solutions to specific 
environmental problems; instead, it produces problemsolving machines that can handle novelty. The nature 
of evolution as a learning process (Watson et al., 2014, 
2016; [[David Power]] et al., 2015; Watson & Szathmary, 2016; 
Czégel et al., 2019; Szilagyi et al., 2020) is transformed 
by the teleonomy. The competency of the parts 
enables better generalization during evolutionaryscale learning; it does not only learn one way of 
being a successful organism, it effectively learns a 
class of feasible organisms, because the competition 
and [[Cooperation]] of goal-directed components (Gawne 
et al., 2020) map many different starting points to a 
functional anatomy.
Over time, a lineage learns not only how to exploit 
a specific niche successfully, but also how to manage 
successfully in novel circumstances (changes of 
the environment and of its own parts, including 
mutations and other perturbations, as in the many 
examples above). Moreover, by working through an 
indirect, complex intermediate layer (development 
and physiology), evolution is forced to generalize 
(which would not happen with direct encodings). 
This enables evolution to give rise to problem-solving 
machines with generalization to novel circumstances. 
This is becoming strikingly apparent in the advent of 
biorobotics with emergent properties.
EVOLUTION HAS ALREADY LEARNED 
TO GENERALIZE BEYOND DEFAULT 
MORPHOLOGIES
The robustness of life under perturbation of the 
external environment and of internal components 
reveals the essence of teleonomic systems: competency 
in pursuing goals. Where do the specific goal states 
come from? What determines the set points towards 
which a given system will expend energy and effort?

implement a specific structural and functional outcome 
reliably, we generally say that these are explained by 
evolution. The goals towards which cellular collectives 
navigate competently in various spaces traditionally 
have had two explanations: direct selection ‘forces’ 
and side-effects (spandrels) of other features that have 
been selected (Gould & Lewontin, 1979; Kull, 2014). 
This might, perhaps, be reasonable for the standard 
class of biological systems evolved in the phylogenetic 
tree on Earth. However, the limits of this paradigm 
are revealed when we expand traditional epigenetics 
to include genuinely novel configurations that have 
never existed before on Earth.
Questions about selves, autonomy, [[Plasticity]] and 
the origin of biological novelty led us to ask what 
would happen if skin cells were removed from a frog 
embryo, dissociated and given a chance to reboot 
their multicellularity in vitro (Blackiston et al., 2021). 
Many outcomes are possible a priori: they could have 
spread out or died or formed a monolayer, etc. Instead 
(Fig. 7), what they [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]] was to reassemble and form a 
novel proto-organism known as a Xenobot (Kriegman 
et al., 2020). These spherical constructs move through 
water by the coherent action of cilia, exhibiting a 
variety of [[Self]]-actuated types of motility. They have a 
developmental sequence of novel forms that are unlike 
the typical Xenopus stages; they repair after damage, 
interact with their environment and show spontaneous 
changes in behaviour. These novel morphologies and 
behaviours do not require transgenes or genomic 
editing; [[Xenobots]] repurpose their native hardware (e.g. 
cilia, which are normally used to redistribute mucus) 
to new functionality. Amazingly, deprived of their 
normal way of reproducing, the emergent processes of 
Xenobots discover kinematic self-replication (a novel 
mode of reproduction not used by any other organism 
on Earth, to our knowledge), which they implement by 
herding loose collections of cells in their environment 
together to form the next generation of Xenobots 
(Kriegman et al., 2021). Nothing has been added 
to their completely wild-type frog genome; instead, 
developmental constraints have been removed. 
Without the normal instructions from the rest of the 
body telling these skin cells to form a passive, twodimensional boundary layer to keep out the bacteria (a 
system of low [[Agency]]), the true capacities of this cellular 
collective are revealed; it forms a three-dimensional 
[[Individuality]] with a more exciting life of self-initiated 
motile behaviour. The [[Collective Intelligence]] of these 
cells is revealed as, despite a novel environment and 
novel internal configuration that never existed in the 
frog evolutionary lineage, they discover novel ways to 
be a coherent organism. Their [[Problem Space]] is normally 
distorted by the larger collective, but their default 
geodesic through option space (and their baseline 
preferences in [[Morphospace]]) are revealed when these 
influences are removed. All this self-assembly and 
[[Emergent Morphogenesis]] takes place in 48 h and does 
not require aeons of evolutionary forces to become a 
good Xenobot.
If the answer to ‘Where do a frog’s shape and 
behaviour come from?’ is ‘Long periods of selection 
and interaction with the environment that sculpt 
the genome to be a great frog’, then where do the 
anatomical and behavioural goals of Xenobots 
originate? Their anatomical and behavioural goals are 
emergent (Veloz, 2021), rather than directly selected 
for over aeons of sculpting by selection. A number of 
researchers have emphasized information arising from 
generic laws of form (Beloussov & Grabovsky, 2007; 
Beloussov, 2008; Newman, 2014, 2019; Zhang et al., 
2021), from mathematics (Brigandt, 2013; Lange, 2013; 
Green & Batterman, 2017; Reutlinger, 2017) and from 
environmentally initiated novelties (West-Eberhard, 
1998, 2005a, b; Shapiro, 2022). These Xenobots are 
only the beginning of a large class of beings that 
challenge us to develop a better understanding of how 
goal states arise in novel contexts and how evolution 
exploits the laws of physics and computation in the 
context of teleonomic processes.
A key area of research concerns how goal dir­
ectedness is scaled during evolution, enabling beings 
with increasingly large cognitive horizons with 
respect to the goals they can pursue (Levin, 2019). 
Bioengineering is a powerful means of studying this 
aspect of collective [[Intelligence]], because it allows us to 
manipulate which components (with what goals) are 
connected together and precisely how their different 
modules can interact in the swarm. One set of models 
concerns the coupling of subunits with respect to the 
three components of a homeostatic loop: sensing state, 
storing a memory of the set point, and taking actions 
to reduce error. This is beginning to be explored in 
robotics and machine learning; in one example, robots 
can adapt to new situations because their components 
are behaving homeostatically (Di Paolo, 2000). 
A multi-scale [[Competency Architecture]], as exploited 
by chimaeric techniques, is not only an interesting 
path forward (biological inspiration) for artificial 
intelligence, but is also helping to dissolve artificial 
barriers across fields.
CHIMAERISM HELPS TO DISSOLVE 
OUTDATED CONCEPTS
Chimaerism is a type of conceptual universal acid, 
dissolving existing terminology that is not based on 
deep concepts but is instead a relic of parochial contin­
gencies of our familiar forms (Bongard & Levin, 2021).

The ability to mix any two biological systems, in any 
arbitrary proportion, reveals the continuous nature of 
terms that are often thought to be binary (Boldt, 2018). 
This strongly extends the gradual view, already 
required when taking evolution and developmental 
biology seriously, which lends no support to any sharp 
line between ‘true [[Cognition]]’ in complex brains and 
‘just physics’ that is sometimes said to occur in their 
phylogenetic and ontogenic precursors.
As we combine living material with electronics 
and computer software (Table 1), sharp distinctions 
between ‘machine’ and ‘organism’ become untenable. 
There is no principled way to draw a clean line, and any 
combination (from a being with 95% human brain + 5% 
smart implant to one that is 5% human brain tissue in 
a 95% robotic body, and every proportion in between) 
is a viable being. Rather than providing a rigorous way 
to distinguish life from ‘mere machines’ (as many have 
argued), [[Teleonomy]] emerges as a much more valuable 
scientific tool: a parameter for defining a continuum 
of beings on which can be built a deep framework for 
understanding [[Agency]] in diverse implementations. The 
same is true for terms such as evolved vs. designed; by 
themselves, these terms provide no powerful insight 
into the nature, capabilities or [[Moral Worth]] of any 
[[Self]]. Evolutionary algorithms are increasingly being 
used by engineers to design new constructs, while 
we ourselves are the products of evolution (and our 
engineering is thus a secondary effect of operations of 
evolved systems).
There is an important lesson in the remarkable fact 
that cells and engineered materials can work together 
so seamlessly: life itself does not respect the distinction 
between the two, which persists only because of our 
historical limitations (which are now increasingly 
being lifted by progress in bioengineering). The life 
vs. machine distinction is relevant only to the lowest 
class of machines available in prior decades and is not 
fundamental. The dichotomy is seen to be fallacious 
in several ways. What is essential about machines 
is not what they are made of (metal vs. cytoplasm), 
but that they are systems that operate according to 
predictable rules and thus can be manipulated. If this 
were not true, evolution would not work. Evolution 
does not build upon a blank canvas; instead, it alters 
signals given to biological components that already 
have a background behaviour (e.g. new signalling 
factors to change the way in which cells move or 
differentiate during development). This process is 
greatly potentiated by the fact that each component is 
a machine in the important functional sense of being 
controllable and reliable for specific outcomes.
The modules of living things (from organs to 
molecular networks) constitute a sophisticated class 
of machines, which have homeostatic and allostatic 
loops. This means that both evolution and engineering 
can be potentiated by the same property: [[Competency]] 
to get a job done even when the environment and 
composition change (within limits, of course). Life 
and engineering are interoperable precisely because 
of teleonomy. Each subsystem has evolved to exploit 
the physics of internal and external components 
without knowing in advance what the situation will 
be. The multi-scale [[Competency Architecture]] is highly 
opportunistic, because each goal-driven subunit 
has no access to the reality of its environment, only 
to inputs it receives, and must construct a model of 
what to do, on the fly (Friston, 2013; Constant et al., 
2018). This means that, as with the new class of robots 
with no prior fixed map of their structure (Bongard 
et al., 2006), they will exert adaptive function even 
in novel circumstances. To living creatures arising 
from a single cell, all scenarios (whether ‘natural’ or 
‘artificial’) are new circumstances, in which they learn 
to survive.
Already today, human bodies are augmented with 
prosthetics that allow them to control assistive 
devices, use novel and additional effectors, such as 
third limbs (Penaloza & Nishio, 2018), and make use 
of new inputs in sensory substitution (Danilov & Tyler, 
2005; Nagel et al., 2005; Ptito et al., 2005). These drive 
changes in cognition (Kieliba et al., 2021), illustrating 
the deep [[Plasticity]] of life. Teleonomic functions enable 
the immediate, efficient use of these evolutionarily 
novel configurations because life does not manage 
outcomes bottom up: the implementation details are 
black boxed and do not break control systems when 
each level can focus on providing top-down guidance, 
letting the underlying modules achieve the goals with 
existing mechanisms.

Of course, the [[Plasticity]] and interoperability of living 
things has been exploited by evolutionary arms races, 
enabling some biological systems to hijack others, 
such as zombie ants produced by a fungal controller 
(Hughes et al., 2011, 2016; de Bekker et al., 2015; 
Steinkraus et  al., 2017; Elya et  al., 2018) and 
commensal bacteria being able to dictate the number 
of heads in regenerating flatworms (Williams 
et al., 2020). Importantly, the plasticity revealed by 
chimaerism (and older work on sensory augmentation; 
Bach-y-Rita et al., 1969) also reminds us that modern 
humans do not represent the upper limit of goal-driven 
[[Cognition]]. The charge of ‘anthropomorphism’ is thus a 
pre-scientific world view, in which human beings had 
some sort of magic that was unique and [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]] not exist, 
even in weaker forms, anywhere else. The progressive 
augmentation, diversification, biomedical engineering 
and instrumentization of human brains will strongly 
emphasize the limitations of the notion of absolute, 
discrete natural kinds (e.g. species) and the need to 
look for what is essential or deep about such categories.
It is clear now that terminology and distinctions 
based on contingencies of material and origin story 
will not survive the coming decades of chimaeric 
technologies that will erase boundaries and extend 
capabilities. We propose that the best conceptual 
framework to take their place is one based on 
understanding what is essential about agents: their 
degree of [[Competency]] in pursuing goals, and the scale 
of goals they are capable of pursuing. This cybernetic 
view, together with bioengineering tools, provides 
researchers and philosophers with an enormous 
[[Problem Space]] of possible beings, in which the whole 
panoply of evolved natural forms is only a small subset 
(Fig. 2). All of Darwin’s ‘endless forms most beautiful’ 
exist in a small region within the space of viable 
configurations. The field of [[Evo-Devo]] can expand to 
bio-robo, and synthetic bioengineering is moving from 
[[Artificial Life]] working in chemical and metabolic 
spaces (Ollé-Vila et al., 2016) to [[Synthetic Morphology]] 
working in anatomical and behavioural spaces, in 
order to explore the variety of possible bodies and 
minds (Sloman, 1984; Yampolskiy, 2015).
WHAT IS NEXT: EXPANDING THE OPTION 
SPACE OF BEINGS DRIVES A RESEARCH 
PROGRAMME
Deriving the rules of [[Emergent Morphogenesis]] and 
behaviour using only the examples of natural species 
on Earth is like testing a hypothesis on the same set 
of data that generated it; chimaeric and bioengineered 
beings give us the opportunity truly to evaluate the 
quality of future models of robustness and plasticity 
with respect to anatomical goal states. Moreover, 
the interoperability of life at all levels (i.e. the fact 
that chimaeras and [[Cyborg]] are viable) reveals that 
there are no natural kinds with respect to species 
(Devitt, 2010; Austin, 2017). Natural life forms do not 
represent privileged, perfect outcomes. The general 
distaste for novel beings seen in science fiction (e.g. 
Wells’ ‘The Island of Dr. Moreau’) is a hold-over 
from a pre-Darwinian essentialism that neglects 
the fact that natural species simply exemplify a 
subset of possibilities for staying represented in the 
biosphere, possibilities that have been found thus far 
by a meandering, randomly driven search process 
(evolution) that optimizes for nothing more intelligent 
than biomass. It is very likely that rational design 
(bioengineering) can do better than this, once we 
understand the [[Collective Intelligence]] of molecular 
pathways, cells and tissues and learn to guide their 
[[Teleonomy]].
The option space of beings enables us truly to see 
life for the first time, in the absence of standard 
phylogenetic relationships that enlighten some 
aspects but obscure many others. A key aspect that 
is revealed by this way of viewing life is the [[Cellular Competency]]; the basal [[Intelligence]] of many levels 
of organization in a given body, all of which exhibit 
teleonomic behaviour in their own [[Problem Space]]. 
Recognizing this behaviour, and the specific goals 
being pursued, is an IQ test that scientists (observers) 
take when evaluating the [[Agency]] of unconventional 
agents; our ability to detect, understand and manage 
[[Teleonomy]] says as much about our intelligence as it 
does about the system being studied.
The emerging field at the intersection of synthetic 
developmental biology, computer science and cognitive 
science implies numerous opportunities for next steps 
and further progress. From the perspective of theory/
conceptual advances and specific research directions, 
the following questions need to be developed:
	•	 What is an effective eigenspace for modelling 
agency? What would be the minimal axes for the 
space of all possible teleonomic agents? And how 
do we recognize, quantify and compare teleonomic 
agents in radially diverse embodiments? Even 
gene-regulatory networks, a paradigmatic case of 
deterministic genetic hardware, appear to have 
learning capacity (Watson et  al., 2010; Szabó 
et al., 2012; Gabalda-Sagarra et al., 2018; HerreraDelgado et  al., 2018; Biswas et  al., 2021), and 
teleonomy has been explored in signal transduction 
processes in plants (Gilroy & Trewavas, 2022). It 
is imperative that we abandon the tendency for 
armchair pronouncements of what can and cannot 
be seen as cognitive and instead develop toolkits 
for generating and testing teleonomic models of 
arbitrary systems.

	•	 If evolution is blind and always prefers immediate 
fitness payoffs, how is it that it not only gives rise to 
creatures highly adapted for specific environments, 
but also evolves hardware that can problem solve 
in numerous novel configurations never seen 
before? How does evolution capitalize on the laws 
of physics and computation to generalize so well 
from specific examples to highly diverse possible 
instantiations? Specifically, how does [[Teleonomy]] 
potentiate the evolutionary search for yet larger 
teleonomic systems, and how can engineers do the 
same?
	•	 Can the notion of external environment ([[Umwelt]]; 
[[Jacob von Uexküll]], 2010) be extended to a multi-scale 
concept, in which adjacent cells, tissues, etc. are 
each other’s environment? Can molecular pathways 
and biophysical dynamics be thought of as 
[[Affordances]] for systems to compete and cooperate 
within and across levels in the organism (Queller 
& Strassmann, 2009; Gawne et al., 2020)? Links to 
existing thought on the extended organism (Turner, 
2000) and [[Extended Mind]] (Clark & Chalmers, 1998) 
are within reach.
	•	 What is the relationship or overlap between the 
sets demarcated by ‘life’ and ‘[[Cognition]]’? If all 
(most?) components in living things are teleonomic 
agents and are thus somewhere on the continuum 
of cognition (Fig. 1), are all living things cognitive? 
What is a useful definition of ‘life’, given that 
teleonomic agents can be produced by engineering 
with organic or inorganic parts? Although modern 
life is necessarily teleonomic (in order to survive 
in the biosphere), could there have been very early 
life forms that were not teleonomic? Could current 
efforts at truly minimal synthetic life (Hanczyc et al., 
2011; Cejkova et al., 2017) clarify the relationship 
between teleonomy and physics?
	•	 How can we develop a semiotics of synthetic agents 
(Tsuda et al., 2009) and their Umwelten (Manicka 
& Harvey, 2008; Beer, 2014) to gain a better 
understanding of the ways in which teleonomy 
provides the ratchet that drives the great transitions 
of cognitive capacity along the continuum? How can 
we develop ways of manipulating biological systems 
(such as [[Morphogenesis]]) via communication and 
motivation, rather than [[Bottom-Up Control]]?
	•	 Can we develop artificial neural networks whose 
output is not specific solutions to specific problems, 
but rather seeds that determine machines that 
solve problems (Moore et  al., 2018)? Can we 
imitate the learning and generalization capacity 
of evolution in our machine learning architectures, 
such that each level of the output specifies a 
flexible design for an [[Self]] that functions in the 
[[Problem Space]]?
	•	 Can we make new autonomous robotics via a [[Multiscale Competency Architecture]] (a generalization of 
the [[Subsumption Architecture]]; Brooks, 1986), where 
each layer is an agent that constructs models of 
itself and its environment? Robots made of parts 
having [[Agency]] (teleonomy all the way down) will, for 
the first time, become vulnerable to the occasional 
defections of [[Cancer]], but will gain the flexibility and 
robustness of life owing to the massive adaptability 
to novelty that results from dynamic [[Cooperation]] 
and competition of goal-driven sub-agents.
TOWARDS A NEW ETHICS BASED ON DEEP 
AGENCY IN THE [[Problem Space]] OF LIFE
There is an aspect of teleonomy that has a positive 
impact on the ethics of chimaeric and bioengineered 
technologies. Making changes at the lower levels 
(e.g. genomic editing) tends to result in systemlevel outcomes that are hard to predict (Lobo et al., 
2014). When one is forced to manage all the outcomes 
directly (as when manipulating a system bottom up), 
a likely outcome is ‘unhappy monsters’ (i.e. ethically 
unacceptable creatures containing mismatched 
components that do not work harmoniously together). 
A simple example occurs in planarians: inducing 
secondary heads with biochemical inducers makes 
heads that are not properly scaled to the rest of the 
organism, whereas nudging the top-level ‘head vs. 
tail’ decision in the native bioelectric circuit leads 
to all of the downstream properties being handled 
by the system itself and results in perfectly scaled, 
functional heads (Durant et al., 2019). In general, 
changes introduced at the micro-level tend to wreck 
complex systems more than changes that are input at 
the higher level; optimizing the level of intervention 
for specific biomedical and synthetic purposes will 
require the incorporation of teleonomic models into 
the biophysics frameworks used almost exclusively 
today (despite the work on [[Modularity]] in evolution; 
Payne et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2014). Controlling 
biology top down, via experiences and stimuli that 
rely as much as possible on the native collective 
[[Intelligence]] of its parts, is likely to produce much 
more coherent organisms and will provide us with a 
better understanding of life.
The impact of rapidly advancing technologies will 
go far beyond science, encompassing many issues that 
have been dealt with in science fiction but have not 
yet been worked through by thinkers in the fields of 
philosophy of mind, ethics and policy. Our culture is 
in for an upheaval that will far eclipse the controversy 
that fomented around Darwin’s ‘Origin of Species’. 
Our ethics structures are barely sufficient to optimize

Figure 8.  Goal directedness is an invariant for a continuous spectrum of [[Cognition]]. A, biological systems are not only 
structurally hierarchical but also functionally hierarchical: each layer solves unique problems in a relevant [[Problem Space]],

intraspecies interactions; they will need a total 
overhaul when we are surrounded by novel agents of 
every possible configuration. How does one prosecute 
a 50% [[Cyborg]] for its misdeeds? Legal systems based 
on one dimension of human IQ (with a cut-off for 
‘competent’) are in no way ready for a multidimensional 
space of beings with diverse components contributing 
to their mind and behaviour.
Many current legal and moral structures are built 
around a crisp category of ‘human’ within that axis. 
Although we have some provision for ‘diminished 
capacity’ (in legal proceedings), we do not yet have 
any for increased capacity. Neural real-estate is 
readily taken over by functional modules (e.g. in 
the cases of the blind whose visual processing areas 
become used for hearing and other modalities; Van 
Ackeren et al., 2018). Thus, it is very likely that the 
addition of neural tissue to standard brains will 
result in increased processing capacity. The system 
uses a highly adaptive design that can make use of 
resources that do not have to be specified in advance, 
because the various subunits (cortical layers, neurons, 
etc.) are themselves teleonomic agents that relate 
to their neighbours with the same [[Plasticity]] with 
which they face external environments. Members of 
the transhumanist movement have already begun to 
discuss what happens when humanity includes beings 
with a wide range of IQ and moral capacities (e.g. a 
larger cognitive horizon that allows them functionally 
to [[Care]] about far more than today’s human is capable 
of handling). What is a human being? A good answer, 
in future decades, cannot be based on a genetic or 
anatomical description; perhaps it will be based on the 
minimal amount of active [[Compassion]] or functional 
caring (similar to today’s standard human) that a 
being can muster within its [[The Self As Computational Boundary]] (i.e. a 
definition based on capacity for teleonomic action).
Moreover, although Darwin’s revolution created 
a continuous spectrum along which to compare 
[[Intelligence]] (and place moral categories for 
relationships to primates, whales, dogs, etc., in addition 
to complex cases, such as octopuses), a far wider 
reality is beginning to emerge. There is not only a 
large axis representing different amounts of cognitive 
sophistication, but also an immense space of multiple 
dimensions of different types of cognitive capacity. It is 
entirely unclear how creatures within that space will 
relate to each other, making essential the search for an 
invariant on which to base norms (such as complexity 
of the creature’s goal space).
CONCLUSION
Bioengineering expands our subject of inquiry to a 
now-realizable immense [[Problem Space]] of novel living 
agents: true biology in the sense of life as it can be 
(Langton, 1995), rather than zoology/botany. The study 
of these novel beings does two important things. First, 
it helps us to move beyond the historical contingencies 
and familiar (limiting) categories of where [[Agency]] can 
be found in the specific products of one evolutionary 
stream on Earth. We must become comfortable 
thinking about new scales of size and duration, new 
material substrates for life and mind, and new spaces 
in which goals can be sought. Second, it helps us to 
get to the root of a key question: where do goals come 
from in the first place? Synthetic creatures such 
as chimaeras, [[Hybrots]], cyborgs and [[Hybrots]] provide 
empirically tractable model systems in which to study 
[[Emergence]] of the morphological and behavioural goals 
of collective intelligences (any being made of parts) 
that were not shaped by aeons of evolution towards 
specific environments.
(and others to be discovered; [[Nick Bostrom]], 2003; Kurzweil, 2005), whose behaviour can be changed radically by a communication 
encoding a rational argument that changes the motivation, planning, values and commitment of the [[Self]] receiving this. 
C2, C3, between these extremes lies a rich range of intermediate agents, such as simple homeostatic circuits (C2), which 
have set points encoding goal states, and more complex systems, such as animals that can be controlled by training using 
stimuli that communicate to the system how it can achieve its goal of receiving a reward (C3). This continuum is not a linear 
scala naturae; evolution is free to move in any direction in this option space of cognitive capacity. The goal of the scientist is 
to find the optimal position for a given system. Too far to the right results in complex models that do not improve prediction 
and control. Too far to the left and one loses the benefits of [[Downward Causation]] in favour of intractable [[Bottom-Up Control]]. 
This is also a continuum with respect to how much knowledge one has to have about the details of the system in order to 
manipulate its function. For systems in class C1, one has to know a lot about their workings to modify them. For class C2, 
one has to know how to read–write the set point information but does not need to know anything about how the system 
will implement those goals. For class C3, one does not have to know how the system modifies its goal encodings in light 
of experience, because the system does all of this on its own; one only has to provide suitable rewards and punishments. 
Ascertaining the optimal level of [[Teleonomy]] in the objects around us is a key task for scientists interested in understanding 
and managing novel complex systems; this capacity is also a built-in cognitive module for animals navigating complex 
environments, conspecifics, prey, etc. B created after Rosenblueth et al. (1943). A, C images courtesy of Jeremy Guay of

ENGINEERING NOVEL BODIES AND NOVEL MINDS 
© 2022 The [[Linnean Society]] of London, [[Biological Journal Of The Linnean Society]], 2023, 139, 457–486
These new model systems dissolve outdated, binary 
categories, such as ‘machine’ and ‘organism’, that were 
based on the temporary technological limitations of the 
past and will surely not survive the coming advances 
of the next few decades (Bongard & Levin, 2021). 
Fixed Linnean relationships and categories based on 
genomes have served biologists well (although perhaps 
not so well for microbiologists), but these need to be 
replaced in light of the increasingly obvious [[Plasticity]] 
and interoperability of life (Fig. 8). We will soon be 
surrounded by truly ‘endless forms most beautiful’ 
(Darwin, 1859), filling an [[Problem Space]] that Darwin 
could not even have dreamed of (Ollé-Vila et al., 2016). 
They challenge us to define new categories based on 
deep (empirically useful and more philosophically 
sophisticated) criteria and to move beyond an 
assumption that goals are always set by selection.
Future impacts of these ideas will be driven by 
a progressively improved understanding of the 
relationship between the crafter (whether evolution 
or an engineer) and its material. For example, the 
current intellectual property system was developed to 
address work with classical, passive materials, where 
everything is in what the craftsman [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]]; patenting the 
craftsman’s recipe is key. It is not yet suitable for work 
with agential materials, for which the inventor is a 
collaborator with the components. As with the [[Xenobots]], 
where the outcome is as much (or more) dependent on 
the [[Competency]] of cells to carry out specific goals as it is 
on the human providing cues, the outcome of this new 
type of creative work is partly the method, but it is also 
partly what has been discovered about the competency 
of the [[Agential Material]]. These challenges to our ideas 
of intellectual ownership dovetail with similar concerns 
over future inventions by AI agents that serve as tools 
to augment human creativity.
A mature science of [[Teleonomy]] is no more about 
understanding Xenobots and their kin than computer 
science is the study of our current computers. The goal is 
far deeper: understanding the relationship between the 
genome, the software that produces bodies and behaviour, 
and the ability to reach adaptive ends despite diverse 
means on very rapid time scales. Critically, the issue 
of forming and detecting goals requires a specification 
of a complex system to whom the goals belong. What 
defines a [[Self]]? Although immunological (Pradeu, 2019) 
and evolutionary-scale (Strassmann & Queller, 2010) 
theories have been proposed, these are intimately tied to 
(and thus limited by) the types of organisms we observe 
naturally in our biosphere. A more general framework, 
able to encompass and directly compare truly diverse 
agents, needs to be based on teleonomy at its core: a self 
is a goal-directed system, and its level of sophistication 
(ranging from modest inorganic systems to trans-human 
beings) is set by the spatiotemporal scale of the goals it 
can pursue (Levin, 2019).
Chimaeric and synthetic bioengineering enables us 
to leave the Garden of Eden of a finite set of natural 
species and to continue Adam’s task of naming novel 
creatures; more specifically, discovering their true 
nature beyond the facts of their composition and 
origin. The sciences of [[Cybernetics]] and the deep lessons 
of neuroscience, which extend well beyond neurons 
(Friston et al., 2014; Ramstead et al., 2019; Fields et al., 
2020; Fields & Levin, 2020a, b), will be key components 
of this future. At stake are transformative advances in 
[[Regenerative Medicine]] (to get beyond the low-hanging 
fruit reachable by conventional stem cell biology and 
genomic editing approaches), robotics and general AI.
Crucially, this new field suggests not only novel 
capabilities and advances in knowledge, but also the 
need for a new ethics. The frequently voiced statements 
that ‘living things are not machines’ reflect an outdated 
essentialism and a type of magical thinking that trusts 
in clear, binary lines separating evolved living beings 
from designed machines to define our moral duty to 
various agents comfortably. These lines do not exist, 
which will be made painfully clear in the next decades 
as we become surrounded by collections of agents that 
make the iconic Cantina scene in ‘Star Wars’ look [[Tame]] 
in comparison. Significant effort will need to be made as 
science and society mature to include designed beings in 
addition to natural beings, in order to avoid the types of 
ethical lapses to which humans are prone: mistreatment 
of those who do not resemble a familiar in-group in 
composition or origin. The nature of teleonomy as a 
guiding principle cutting across contingencies of origin 
story and composition, and the inevitable expansion of 
life throughout the option space of hybrid forms (Fig. 2), 
provide important conceptual tools for a path forwards 
to a future where we cannot simply guess the capacity 
of an [[Self]] to think and suffer based on what it looks 
like or how closely it resembles a familiar touchstone 
species in the Earth’s phylogenetic lineage. It is not 
clear what a new ethics of life as it can be will look like, 
but some sort of golden rule about [[Compassion]] towards 
systems proportional to their teleonomic capacity might 
be a place from which to start.
