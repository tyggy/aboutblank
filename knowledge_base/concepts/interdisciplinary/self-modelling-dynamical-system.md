# Self-Modelling Dynamical System

## Definition

A self-modelling dynamical system is a system that constructs internal models of its own behavior and states, then uses these memories to inform future actions through associative learning. By developing this capacity for self-reference and recursive modeling, the system can learn from its own patterns and optimize its behavior, creating a feedback loop where visited states become increasingly likely to recur. This process enables the system to adapt and evolve based on its own history rather than external programming alone.
