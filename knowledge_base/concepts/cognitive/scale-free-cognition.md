# Scale-Free Cognition

## Definition

Scale-Free Cognition describes cognitive processes that operate across multiple hierarchical biological scales—from molecular to organismal levels—rather than being confined to neural tissue alone. This framework recognizes that biological systems exhibit similar organizational principles and functional patterns across these different scales, suggesting that cognition emerges as a distributed phenomenon throughout living systems. Rather than viewing the mind as localized in the brain, Scale-Free Cognition proposes that cognitive capabilities are fundamentally multi-scalar, with information processing and adaptive responses occurring at cellular, tissue, and whole-organism levels according to comparable structural and functional rules.
