# Non-Linearly Separable Functions

## Definition

Non-linearly separable functions describe systems where the effect of one input on output changes depending on other inputsâ€”a property that emerges when components adopt complementary heterogeneous roles rather than operating independently. These functions are fundamental to understanding collective intelligence and evolutionary transitions, as they create non-decomposable fitness at the group level that cannot be reduced to individual component behaviors. Their analysis requires deep network architectures and reveals how collectives can exhibit capabilities and adaptive differences that transcend the sum of their parts.
