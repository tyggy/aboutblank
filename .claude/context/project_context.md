# Buddhism & AI Knowledge Base - Project Context

## Overview
This project explores the intersection of Buddhist philosophy, consciousness studies, and artificial intelligence. We're building a comprehensive knowledge base that maps connections between diverse thinkers and concepts.

## Core Research Questions
1. How do different scales and forms of intelligence relate to each other?
2. What is the relationship between understanding, experience, and consciousness?
3. How can we navigate truth and ethics in complex, emergent systems?
4. What forms of care and connection are possible between diverse intelligences?

## Theoretical Framework
- **Buddhist Philosophy**: Non-self, interdependence, mindfulness, compassion
- **Systems Theory**: Emergence, feedback loops, attractors, complexity
- **Consciousness Studies**: Qualia, binding problem, integrated information theory
- **AI/ML**: Alignment, agency, goal-directedness, value learning

## Key Thinkers & Their Contributions

### Michael Levin
- Bioelectric networks and morphogenesis
- Intelligence as navigation in problem spaces
- "Platonic spaces of patterns"
- Collective intelligence and goal-directedness

### Francisco Varela
- Enactivism and embodied cognition
- Ethical know-how vs ethical knowledge
- Autopoiesis and self-organization

### Iain McGilchrist
- Attention and hemispheric specialization
- Different modes of being and knowing
- Truth and value in "The Matter with Things"

### Gregory Bateson
- Ecology of mind
- Levels of learning and communication
- Pattern that connects

## Working Methods
1. **Transcript Analysis**: Extract and synthesize ideas from video content
2. **Concept Mapping**: Identify connections between ideas across thinkers
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Find recurring themes and principles
4. **Synthesis Writing**: Create integrated perspectives on key questions

## Technical Approach
- Use Claude Code for automated processing and analysis
- Maintain markdown-based knowledge base for portability
- Create visualizations of conceptual networks
- Build tools for exploring and navigating the knowledge space

## Current Focus Areas
1. Processing Michael Levin's video transcripts
2. Mapping connections to Buddhist concepts
3. Developing synthesis on intelligence and consciousness
4. Creating practical applications for AI alignment
